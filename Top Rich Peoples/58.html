<p><strong>James Harris</strong> "<strong>Jim</strong>" <strong>Simons</strong> (born 1938) is an American mathematician, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is known as a quantitative investor and in 1982 founded Renaissance Technologies, a private hedge fund based in New York City. Although Simons retired from the fund in 2009, he remains its non-executive chairman and adviser.</p>
<p>He is also known for his studies on pattern recognition for which he developed (with Shiing-Shen Chern) the the Chern&ndash;Simons form,&nbsp;and contributed to the development of string theory by providing a theoretical framework to combine geometry and topology with quantum field theory.&nbsp;Simons was a mathematics professor and subsequent chair of the mathematics department at Stony Brook University.</p>
<p>As a consequence of his investment career, <em>Forbes Magazine</em> estimated Simons' net worth is to be US$18 billion as of February 2017.</p>
<p>In 2016, asteroid 6618 Jimsimons,&nbsp;discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1936, was named after Simons by the International Astronomical Union in honor of his numerous contributions to mathematics and philanthropy.</p>

<p>James Harris Simons was born to a Jewish family,&nbsp;the only child of Marcia (n&eacute;e Kantor)&nbsp;and Matthew Simons, and raised in Brookline, Massachusetts.&nbsp;His father owned a shoe factory.</p>
<p>He received a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1958&nbsp;and a Ph.D., also in mathematics, from the University of California, Berkeley, under supervision of Bertram Kostant in 1961, at the age of 23.</p>

<p>For more than two decades, Simons' Renaissance Technologies' hedge funds, which trade in markets around the world, have employed mathematical models to analyze and execute trades, many automated. Renaissance uses computer-based models to predict price changes in financial instruments. These models are based on analyzing as much data as can be gathered, then looking for non-random movements to make predictions.</p>
<p>Renaissance employs specialists with non-financial backgrounds, including mathematicians, physicists, signal processing experts and statisticians. The firm's latest fund is the Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF).&nbsp;RIEF has historically trailed the firm's better-known Medallion fund, a separate fund that contains only the personal money of the firm's executives.</p>

</dl>
<p>In 2006, Simons was named Financial Engineer of the Year by the International Association of Financial Engineers. In 2007, he was estimated to have personally earned $2.8 billion,&nbsp;$1.7 billion in 2006,&nbsp;$1.5 billion in 2005,&nbsp;(the largest compensation among hedge fund managers that year)&nbsp;and $670 million in 2004.</p>
<h2><span id="Academic_and_scientific_career" class="mw-headline">Academic and scientific career</span></h2>
<p>Simons' mathematical work has primarily focused on the geometry and topology of manifolds. His 1962 Berkeley PhD thesis, written under the direction of Bertram Kostant, gave a new and more conceptual proof of Berger's classification of the holonomy groups of Riemannian manifolds, which is now a cornerstone of modern geometry. He subsequently began to work with Shing-Shen Chern on the theory of characteristic classes, eventually discovering the Chern&ndash;Simons secondary characteristic classes of 3-manifolds, which are deeply related to the Yang-Mills functional on 4-manifolds, and have had a profound effect on modern physics. These and other contributions to geometry and topology led to Simons becoming the 1976 recipient of the AMS Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry. In 2014, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences of the USA.</p>
<p>In 1964, Simons worked with the National Security Agency to break codes.&nbsp;Between 1964 and 1968, he was on the research staff of the Communications Research Division of the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) and taught mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, ultimately joining the faculty at Stony Brook University. In 1968, he was appointed chairman of the math department at Stony Brook University.</p>
<p>Simons was asked by IBM in 1973 to attack the block cipher Lucifer, an early but direct precursor to the Data Encryption Standard (DES).</p>
<p>Simons founded Math for America, a nonprofit organization, in January 2004 with a mission to improve mathematics education in United States public schools by recruiting more highly qualified teachers. He funds a variety of research projects.</p>
<h2><span id="Personal_life" class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>Simons shuns the limelight and rarely gives interviews, citing Benjamin the Donkey in <em>Animal Farm</em> for explanation: "God gave me a tail to keep off the flies. But I'd rather have had no tail and no flies."&nbsp;On October 10, 2009, Simons announced he would retire on January 1, 2010 but remain at Renaissance as nonexecutive chairman.</p>
<h2><span id="Political_and_economic_views" class="mw-headline">Political and economic views</span></h2>
<p>Simons is a major contributor to Democratic Party political action committees. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Simons is currently ranked the #5 donor to federal candidates in the 2016 election cycle, coming behind co-CEO Robert Mercer, who is ranked #1 and generally donates to Republicans.&nbsp;Simons has donated $7 million to Hillary Clinton's Priorities USA Action,&nbsp;$2.6 million to the House and Senate Majority PACs, and $500,000 to EMILY's List.&nbsp;He also donated $25,000 to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham's super PAC.&nbsp;Since 2006 Simons has contributed about $30.6 million to federal campaigns.&nbsp;Since 1990, Renaissance Technologies has contributed $59,081,152 to federal campaigns and since 2001, has spent $3,730,000 on lobbying.</p>

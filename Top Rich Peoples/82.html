<h2><span id="Early_life" class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Early_childhood" class="mw-headline">Early childhood</span></h3>
<p>Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa,&nbsp;the son of Maye Musk (<em>n&eacute;e</em> Haldeman), a model and dietician from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;&nbsp;and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot and sailor. He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974)&nbsp;His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry,&nbsp;and his maternal grandfather was American, from Minnesota.&nbsp;After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria.</p>
<p>At age 10, he developed an interest in computing with the Commodore VIC-20.&nbsp;He taught himself computer programming and at age 12, sold the code for a BASIC-based video game he created called <em>Blastar</em>, to a magazine called <em>PC and Office Technology</em>, for approximately $500.&nbsp;A web version of the game is available online.</p>
<p>Musk was severely bullied throughout his childhood, and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs and then beat him until he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>Musk was initially educated at private schools, attending the English-speaking Waterkloof House Preparatory School. Musk later graduated from Pretoria Boys High School and moved to Canada in June 1989, just before his 18th<span class="nowrap">&nbsp;</span>birthday,&nbsp;after obtaining Canadian citizenship through his Canadian-born mother.</p>
<h3><span id="University" class="mw-headline">University</span></h3>
<p>At the age of 19, Musk was accepted into Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, for undergraduate study. In 1992, after spending two years at Queen's University, Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where, at the age of 24, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from its College of Arts and Sciences, and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from its Wharton School of Business. Musk extended his studies for one year to finish the second bachelor's degree.&nbsp;While at the University of Pennsylvania, Musk and fellow Penn student Adeo Ressi rented a 10-bedroom fraternity house, using it as an unofficial nightclub.</p>
<p>In 1995, at age 24, Musk moved to California to begin a PhD in applied physics and materials science at Stanford University, but left the program after two days to pursue his entrepreneurial aspirations in the areas of the Internet, renewable energy and outer space.&nbsp;In 2002, he became a U.S. citizen.</p>
<h2><span id="Career" class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Zip2" class="mw-headline">Zip2</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote">Main article: Zip2</div>
<p>In 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started Zip2, a web software company, with US$28,000 of their father's money.&nbsp;The company developed and marketed an Internet "city guide" for the newspaper publishing industry.&nbsp;Musk obtained contracts with <em>The New York Times</em> and the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>&nbsp;and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.&nbsp;While at Zip2, Musk wanted to become CEO; however, none of the board members would allow it.&nbsp;Compaq acquired Zip2 for US$307<span class="nowrap">&nbsp;</span>million in cash and US$34<span class="nowrap">&nbsp;</span>million in stock options in February 1999.&nbsp;Musk received 7% or US$22&nbsp;million from the sale.</p>
<h3><span id="X.com_and_PayPal" class="mw-headline">X.com and PayPal</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote">Main article: PayPal</div>
<p>In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10<span class="nowrap">&nbsp;</span>million from the sale of Zip2&nbsp;One year later, the company merged with Confinity,&nbsp;which had a money transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service.&nbsp;Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company leadership, notably over his desire to move PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows.&nbsp;In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5&nbsp;billion in stock, of which Musk received US$165<span class="nowrap">&nbsp;</span>million.&nbsp;Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares.</p>
<h3><span id="SpaceX" class="mw-headline">SpaceX</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote">Main article: SpaceX</div>
<p>In 2001, Musk conceptualized "Mars Oasis"; a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration.&nbsp;In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished ICBMs (Dnepr) that could send the envisioned payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras, however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers,&nbsp;and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin, who had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel; NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and was just leaving Orbital Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group met again with Kosmotras, and were offered one rocket for US$8&nbsp;million, however, this was seen by Musk as too expensive; Musk consequently stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed.&nbsp;According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson,&nbsp;Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. By applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70-percent gross margin.&nbsp;Ultimately, Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-term goal of creating a "true spacefaring civilization".</p>

<p>With US$100<span class="nowrap">&nbsp;</span>million of his early fortune,&nbsp;Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, in May 2002.&nbsp;Musk is chief executive officer (CEO) and chief technology officer (CTO) of the Hawthorne, California-based company. SpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology. The company's first two launch vehicles are the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets (a nod to Star Wars' <em>Millennium Falcon</em>), and its first spacecraft is the Dragon (a nod to <em>Puff the Magic Dragon</em>).&nbsp;In seven years, SpaceX designed the family of Falcon launch vehicles and the Dragon multipurpose spacecraft. In September 2008, SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket became the first privately funded liquid-fueled vehicle to put a satellite into Earth orbit.On May 25, 2012, the SpaceX Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>In 2006, SpaceX was awarded a contract from NASA to continue the development and test of the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the International Space Station,&nbsp;followed by a US$1.6 billion NASA Commercial Resupply Services program contract on December 23, 2008, for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the Space Station, replacing the US Space Shuttle after it retired in 2011.&nbsp;Astronaut transport to the ISS is currently handled solely by the Soyuz, but SpaceX is one of two companies awarded a contract by NASA as part of the Commercial Crew Development program, which is intended to develop a US astronaut transport capability by 2018.&nbsp;On 22 December 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of its Falcon rocket back at the launch pad. This was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space.&nbsp;This first stage recovery was replicated several times in 2016 by landing on an Autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean based recovery platform.</p>
<p>SpaceX is both the largest private producer of rocket motors in the world, and holder of the record for highest thrust-to-weight ratio for any known rocket motor.&nbsp;SpaceX has produced more than 100 operational Merlin 1D engines, currently the world's most powerful motor for its weight.&nbsp;The relatively immense power to weight ratio allows each Merlin 1D motor to vertically lift the weight of 40 average family cars. In combination, the 9 Merlin engines in the Falcon 9 first stage produces anywhere from 5.8 to 6.7&nbsp;MN (1.3 to 1.5&nbsp;million pounds) of thrust, depending on altitude.</p>
<p>Musk was influenced by Isaac Asimov's <em>Foundation</em> series&nbsp;and views space exploration as an important step in expanding&mdash;if not preserving&mdash;the consciousness of human life.&nbsp;Musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us, and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw: an engineered virus, inadvertent creation of a micro black hole, catastrophic global warming or some as-yet-unknown technology could spell the end of us. Humankind evolved over millions of years, but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves. Sooner or later, we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball&mdash;or go extinct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Musk's goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of 10.&nbsp;In a 2011 interview, he said he hopes to send humans to Mars' surface within 10&ndash;20 years.&nbsp;In Ashlee Vance's biography, Musk stated that he wants to establish a Mars colony by 2040, with a population of 80,000.&nbsp;Musk stated that, since Mars' atmosphere lacks oxygen, all transportation would have to be electric (electric cars, electric trains, Hyperloop, electric aircraft).&nbsp;Space X intends to launch a Dragon spacecraft on a Falcon Heavy in 2018 to soft-land on Mars - this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supply-run to Mars building up to later crewed flights.&nbsp;Musk stated in June 2016 that the first unmanned flight of the larger Mars Colonial Transporter (MCT) spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in 2022, to be followed by the first manned MCT Mars flight departing in 2024.&nbsp;In September 2016, Musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize Mars.&nbsp;By 2016, Musk's private trust holds 54% of SpaceX stock, equivalent to 78% of voting shares.</p>

Sooner or later, we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball&mdash;or go extinct.</p>

<p>Musk's goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of 10.&nbsp;In a 2011 interview, he said he hopes to send humans to Mars' surface within 10&ndash;20 years.&nbsp;In Ashlee Vance's biography, Musk stated that he wants to establish a Mars colony by 2040, with a population of 80,000.&nbsp;Musk stated that, since Mars' atmosphere lacks oxygen, all transportation would have to be electric (electric cars, electric trains, Hyperloop, electric aircraft).&nbsp;Space X intends to launch a Dragon spacecraft on a Falcon Heavy in 2018 to soft-land on Mars - this is intended to be the first of a regular cargo mission supply-run to Mars building up to later crewed flights.&nbsp;Musk stated in June 2016 that the first unmanned flight of the larger Mars Colonial Transporter (MCT) spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in 2022, to be followed by the first manned MCT Mars flight departing in 2024.&nbsp;In September 2016, Musk revealed details of his plan to explore and colonize Mars.&nbsp;By 2016, Musk's private trust holds 54% of SpaceX stock, equivalent to 78% of voting shares.</p>

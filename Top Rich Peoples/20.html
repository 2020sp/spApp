<p>In 1957, a military coup overthrew the government of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram with allegations of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em>,&nbsp;which is an offense against the dignity of the monarch, punishable under Thai law.&nbsp;This began a new and long-lasting relationship between the monarch and military,leading the king to condone the Thammasat University massacre in defense of his throne, and support a series of military dictatorships.&nbsp;Although Bhumibol did invite public criticism in a 2005 speech,&nbsp;the <em>l&egrave;se majest&eacute;</em> laws have not been revoked by the Thai parliament.</p>
<p><em>Forbes</em> estimated Bhumibol's fortune&mdash;including property and investments managed by the Crown Property Bureau (CPB), a unique body that is neither private nor government-owned&mdash;to be US$30 billion in 2010, and he was the head of the magazine's list of the "world's richest royals" from 2008 to 2013.&nbsp;In May 2014, Bhumibol's wealth was once again listed as US$30 billion.Officially the assets managed by the CPB are owned by the crown as an institution, not Bhumibol Adulyadej as an individual.</p>
<p>After 2006, Bhumibol suffered declining health and spent extended periods at Siriraj Hospital, where he died on 13 October 2016. He was generally highly revered by the people in Thailand&nbsp;&ndash; many even saw him as close to divine.&nbsp;Notable political activists and Thai citizens who criticized the king or the institution of monarchy were often forced to exile the country or suffered frequent imprisonments.</p>
<p>His successor Vajiralongkorn does not share the popularity of his father, leading to concerns that the Thai monarchy will lose prestige and influence under the latter's reign.</p>
<h2><span id="Etymology" class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>Bhumibol's U.S. birth certificate reads simply "<strong>Baby Songkla</strong>", as the parents had to consult his uncle, King Rama VII (Prajadhipok), then head of the House of Chakri, for an auspicious name. The king chose a name of Sanskrit origin, <em>Bhumibol Adulyadej</em> (Devanagari: भूमिबल अतुल्यतेज, <small>IAST</small>: <em>Bhūmibala Atulyateja</em>), a compound of <em>Bhūmi</em> (भूमि), meaning "Land"; <em>Bala</em> (बल), meaning "Strength" or "Power"; <em>Atulya</em> (अतुल्य), meaning "Incomparable"; and <em>Tej</em> (तेज), meaning "Power". Thus, <em>Bhūmibala Atulyateja</em>, or <em>Bhumibol Adulyadej</em> as it is transliterated in Thai, literally means "Strength of the Land, Incomparable Power".</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Bhumibol was born at Cambridge Hospital (now Mount Auburn Hospital) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the United States, on 5 December 1927.&nbsp;He was the youngest son of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla, and his commoner wife Mom Sangwan (later Princess Srinagarindra, the Princess Mother). His father was enrolled in the public health program at Harvard University, which is why Bhumibol was the only monarch to be born in the US.&nbsp;Bhumibol had an older sister, Princess Galyani Vadhana, and an older brother, Prince Ananda Mahidol.</p>
<p>Bhumibol came to Thailand in 1928, after his father obtained a certificate from Harvard. His father died of kidney failure in September 1929, when Bhumibol was less than two years old.&nbsp;He briefly attended Mater Dei school in Bangkok, but in 1933 his mother took her family to Switzerland, where he continued his education at the &Eacute;cole nouvelle de la Suisse romande in Lausanne. In 1934 Bhumibol was given his first camera, which ignited his lifelong enthusiasm for photography.&nbsp;When Bhumibol's childless uncle Prajadhipok abdicated in 1935, his nine-year-old brother Ananda became the new King Rama VIII. However, the family remained in Switzerland and the affairs of the head of state were conducted by a regency council. They returned to Thailand for only two months in 1938. In 1942, Bhumibol became a jazz enthusiast, and started to play the saxophone, a passion that he kept throughout his life.&nbsp;He received the <em>baccalaur&eacute;at des lettres</em> (high-school diploma with a major in French literature, Latin, and Greek) from the Gymnase Classique Cantonal of Lausanne, and by 1945 had begun studying sciences at the University of Lausanne, when World War II ended and the family was able to return to Thailand.</p>

<div class="thumb tleft">
<p>Bhumibol ascended the throne following the death by gunshot wound of his brother, King Ananda Mahidol, on 9 June 1946, under circumstances that remain unclear. While a first government statement stated that Ananda had accidentally shot himself,&nbsp;an investigation committee ruled this was virtually impossible.&nbsp;Two palace aides were eventually convicted of regicide and executed. A third possibility, that Bhumibol accidentally shot his brother while the brothers played with their pistols, was never seriously considered, despite the British official investigation's chronology placing Bhumibol as being the last visitor to the sleeping king's bedroom 20 minutes prior to the shot.</p>
<p>Bhumibol succeeded his brother, but returned to Switzerland before the end of the 100-day mourning period. Despite his interest in science and technology, he changed his major and enrolled in law and political science to prepare for his duties as head of state. His uncle, Rangsit, Prince of Chainat, was appointed Prince Regent. In Bhumibol's name, Prince Rangsit authorized a military coup that overthrew the government of Thamrongnawasawat in November 1947.&nbsp;The regent also signed the 1949 constitution, which returned to the monarchy many of the powers it had lost by the 1932 Revolution.</p>
<p>In December 1946, the Siamese government allocated several hundred thousand dollars for the ceremonial cremation of the remains of the late King Ananda, a necessary preliminary to the coronation of Bhumibol who was required by religious custom to light the funeral pyre. Unsettled conditions in 1947 following a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat resulted in a postponement, and court astrologers determined that March 2, 1949 was the most auspicious date.</p>
<p>While finishing his degree in Switzerland, Bhumibol visited Paris frequently. It was in Paris that he first met Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara, daughter of the Thai ambassador to France (Nakkhatra Mangala) and a great-granddaughter of King Chulalongkorn and thus a cousin of Bhumibol. She was then 15 years old and training to be a concert pianist.</p>
<p>On 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol was driving a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he collided with the rear of a braking truck 10&nbsp;km outside Lausanne. He injured his back, suffered paralysis in half of his face and incurred cuts on his face that cost him the sight of his right eye&nbsp;Both the royal cremation and coronation had to be postponed once more.&nbsp;While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that Bhumibol could get to know her better. Bhumibol selected for her a boarding school in Lausanne, Riante Rive. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949, and they were married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation. Their wedding was described by The New York Times as &ldquo;the shortest, simplest royal wedding ever held in the land of gilded elephants and white umbrellas&rdquo;. The ceremony was performed by Bhumibol's ageing grandmother, Savang Vadhana.</p>
<p>Bhumibol and Sirikit have four children:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Formerly HRH) Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, born 5 April 1951 in Lausanne, Switzerland; married Peter Ladd Jensen (now divorced), and has two daughters. Her son, Bhumi Jensen, was killed in the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.</li>
<li>King Maha Vajiralongkorn, born 28 July 1952; married Mom Luang Soamsawali Kitiyakara (later divorced and became HRH the Princess Niece); one daughter. Then married Yuvadhida Polpraserth (later divorced); four sons and a daughter. Third marriage was to Srirasmi Suwadee (now divorced); one son.</li>
<li>HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, born 2 April 1955; never married, no issue</li>
<li>HRH Princess Chulabhorn Walailak, born 4 July 1957; married Virayudh Tishyasarin, (now divorced); two daughters</li>

Bhumibol at his coronation at the Grand Palace.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>After presiding over the long-delayed, ceremonial cremation of his brother Ananda Mahidol, Bhumibol was crowned King of Thailand on 5 May 1950 in the Baisal Daksin Throne Hall in the Grand Palace in Bangkok. It was the first coronation ceremony of a Thai sovereign to rule under the system of constitutional monarchy.&nbsp;During the ceremony, he pledged that he would "reign with righteousness for the benefit and happiness of the Siamese people" ("เราจะครองแผ่นดินโดยธรรม เพื่อประโยชน์สุขแห่งมหาชนชาวสยาม").&nbsp;Notable elements associated with the coronation included the Bahadrabith Throne beneath the Great White Umbrella of State; and he was presented with the royal regalia and utensils.</p>
<p>In 1950 on Coronation Day, Bhumibol's consort was made Queen (Somdej Phra Boromarajini). The date of his coronation is celebrated each 5 May in Thailand as Coronation Day, a public holiday. On 9 June 2006, Bhumibol celebrated his 60th anniversary as the King of Thailand, becoming the longest reigning monarch in Thai history.</p>
<p>The royal couple spent their honeymoon at Hua Hin beach in southern Thailand before they returned to Switzerland, where the King completed his university studies. They returned to Thailand in 1951.</p>
<p>Following the death of his grandmother Queen Savang Vadhana, Bhumibol entered a 15-day monkhood (22 October 1956&nbsp;&ndash; 5 November 1956) at Wat Bowonniwet, as is customary for Buddhist males on the death of elder relatives. He was ordained by the Supreme Patriarch on 22 October 1956 at the Royal Chapel of the Emerald Buddha in the Grand Palace.&nbsp;During this time, Sirikit was appointed his regent. She was later appointed Queen Regent (Somdej Phra Boromarajininat) in recognition of this.</p>
<p>Although Bhumibol was sometimes referred to as King Rama IX in English, Thais referred to him as <em>Nai Luang</em> or <em>Phra Chao Yu Hua</em> (ในหลวง or พระเจ้าอยู่หัว), which translated to "the King" and "Lord Upon our Heads", respectively. He was also called <em>Chao Chiwit</em> ("Lord of Life").Formally, he was referred to as <em>Phrabat Somdet Phra Chao Yu Hua</em> (พระบาทสมเด็จพระเจ้าอยู่หัว) or, in legal documents, <em>Phrabat Somdet Phra Paraminthara Maha Bhumibol Adulyadej</em> (พระบาทสมเด็จพระปรมินทรมหาภูมิพลอดุลยเดช), and in English as His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. He signed his name as ภูมิพลอดุลยเดช ป.ร. (Bhumibol Adulyadej Por Ror; this is the Thai equivalent of Bhumibol Adulyadej Rex).</p>

Marshal and Mrs. Phibunsongkhram with Eleanor Roosevelt</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the early years of his reign, during the government of military dictator Plaek Phibunsongkhram, Bhumibol had no real political power and was little more than a ceremonial figure under the military-dominated government. In August 1957, six months after parliamentary elections, General Sarit Thanarat accused the government of Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> due to its conduct of the 2,500th anniversary celebration of Buddhism.&nbsp;On 16 September 1957, Phibunsongkhram went to Bhumibol to seek support for his government.&nbsp;Bhumibol advised the field marshal to resign to avoid a coup. Phibunsongkhram refused. That evening, Sarit Thanarat seized power. Two hours later Bhumibol imposed martial law throughout the kingdom.&nbsp;Bhumibol issued a proclamation appointing Sarit as "military defender of the capital" without anyone countersigning the proclamation. It included the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas it appears that the public administration by the government under the premiership of Field Marshal P. Phibunsongkhram is untrustworthy, and that the government could not maintain the public order; and whereas the military, led by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, has successfully taken over the public administration and now acts as the Military Defender of the Capital; now, therefore, I do hereby appoint Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat as the Military Defender of the Capital, and command that all the citizens shall remain calm whilst all the government officers shall serve the orders issued by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat. This Proclamation shall come into force immediately. Done this 16th Day of September, Buddhist Era 2500 (1957).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span id="Sarit_Thanarat_era" class="mw-headline">Sarit Thanarat era</span></h3>
<p>During Sarit's dictatorship, the monarchy was revitalised. Bhumibol attended public ceremonies, toured the provinces and patronised development projects. Under Sarit, the practice of crawling in front of royalty during audiences, banned by King Chulalongkorn, was revived in certain situations and the royal-sponsored Thammayut Nikaya order was revitalised. For the first time since the absolute monarchy was overthrown, a king was conveyed up the Chao Phraya River in a Royal Barge Procession to offer robes at temples.</p>
<p>Other disused ceremonies from the classical period of the Chakri Dynasty, such as the royally patronised ploughing ceremony (Thai: พิธีพืชมงคล), were also revived.Bhumibol's birthday (5 December) was declared the national day, replacing the previous national day, the anniversary of the Siamese revolution of 1932 (24 June).&nbsp;Upon Sarit's death on 8 December 1963, an unprecedented 21 days of mourning were declared in the palace. A royal five-tier umbrella shaded his body while it lay in state. Long-time royal adviser Phraya Srivisarn Vacha later noted that no Prime Minister ever had such an intimate relationship with Bhumibol as Sarit.</p>
<p>Bhumibol biographer Paul Handley, in <em>The King Never Smiles</em>, writes that the dictator Sarit was Bhumibol's tool; political scientist Thak Chaloemtiarana writes that Sarit used Bhumibol in order to build his own credibility.</p>

<p>In 1992, Bhumibol played a key role in Thailand's transition to a democratic system. A coup on 23 February 1991 returned Thailand to military dictatorship. After a general election in 1992, the majority parties invited General Suchinda Kraprayoon, a leader of the coup group, to be prime minister. This caused much dissent, which escalated into demonstrations that led to a large number of deaths when the military was brought in to control protesters. The situation became increasingly critical as police and military forces clashed with protesters. Violence and riots spread to many areas of the capital with rumours of a rift among the armed forces.</p>
<p>Amidst the fear of civil war, Bhumibol intervened. He summoned Suchinda and the leader of the pro-democracy movement, retired Major General Chamlong Srimuang, to a televised audience, and urged them to find a peaceful resolution. At the height of the crisis, the sight of both men appearing together on their knees (in accordance with royal protocol) made a strong impression on the nation, and led to Suchinda's resignation soon afterwards.</p>
<p>It was one of the few occasions in which Bhumibol directly and publicly intervened in a political conflict. A general election was held shortly afterward, leading to a civilian government.</p>

<h3><span id="2003_War_on_Drugs" class="mw-headline">2003 War on Drugs</span></h3>
<p>In his 4 December 2002 speech on the eve of his birthday, King Bhumibol spoke about the rise in drug use, the high social costs and deaths caused by drugs, and called for a "war on drugs".&nbsp;Privy Councillor General Phichit Kunlawanit called on the Thaksin Shinawatra government to use its majority in parliament to establish a special court to deal with drug dealers, stating that "if we execute 60,000 the land will rise and our descendants will escape bad karma".</p>
<p>On 14 January 2003, Thaksin launched a campaign to rid "every square inch of the country" of drugs.&nbsp;His "war on drugs" campaign consisted of setting provincial arrest and seizure quotas including "blacklists", awarding government officials for achieving targets, and threatening punishment for those who failed to make the quota, targeted dealers, and propagated a ruthless carrying out of the campaign. In the first three months, Human Rights Watch reported that 2,275 people were killed, almost double the number normally killed in drug-related violence.&nbsp;Human rights critics claimed a large number were extrajudicially executed.&nbsp;The War on Drugs was widely criticized by the international community.</p>
<p>According to the Narcotics Control Board, the campaign was effective in reducing drug consumption, especially in schools.&nbsp;The War on Drugs was one of the most popular policies of the Thaksin government.&nbsp;Bhumibol, in a 2003 birthday speech, praised Thaksin and criticized those who counted only dead drug dealers while ignoring deaths caused by drugs.</p>
<p>"Victory in the War on Drugs is good. They may blame the crackdown for more than 2,500 deaths, but this is a small price to pay. If the prime minister failed to curb the drug trade, over the years the number of deaths would easily surpass this toll."</p>
<p>Bhumibol also asked the commander of the police to investigate the killings.&nbsp;Police Commander Sant Sarutanond reopened investigations into the deaths, and again claimed that few of the deaths were at the hands of the police.</p>
<p>After the 2006 coup, the military junta appointed a committee led by former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakorn to investigate deaths in the war on drugs.&nbsp;The committee found that over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drug trade and blamed the violence on a government "shoot-to-kill" policy based on flawed blacklists. However, no one has been prosecuted, with interim Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont stating that there was insufficient evidence to take legal action.</p>
<p>While he was opposition leader, Abhisit Vejjajiva accused Thaksin of crimes against humanity in the war on drugs. After he became Prime Minister, Abhisit opened an investigation led by former attorney-general Kampee Kaewcharoen, claiming that a successful probe could lead to prosecution by the International Criminal Court.&nbsp;Abhisit's investigation failed to find or publicize any evidence linking Thaksin or members of his government to extrajudicial killings.</p>

<div class="hatnote">See also: 2005&ndash;06 Thai political crisis</div>
<p>Weeks before the April 2006 legislative election, the Democrat Party-led opposition and the People's Alliance for Democracy petitioned Bhumibol to appoint a replacement prime minister and cabinet. Demands for royal intervention were met with much criticism from the public. Bhumibol, in a speech on 26 April 2006, responded, "Asking for a Royally-appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, pardon me, a mess. It is irrational".</p>
<p>After publicly claiming victory in the boycotted April parliamentary elections, Thaksin Shinawatra had a private audience with the king. A few hours later, Thaksin appeared on national television to announce that he would be taking a break from politics.</p>
<p>In May 2006, the Sondhi Limthongkul-owned <em>Manager Daily</em> newspaper published a series of articles describing the "Finland Plot", alleging that Thaksin and former members of the Communist Party of Thailand planned to overthrow the king and seize control of the nation. No evidence was ever produced to verify the existence of such a plot, and Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai party vehemently denied the accusations and sued the accusers.</p>
<p>In a rare, televised speech to senior judges, Bhumibol requested the judiciary to take action to resolve the political crisis.&nbsp;On 8 May 2006, the Constitutional Court invalidated the results of the April elections and ordered new elections scheduled for 15 October 2006.&nbsp;The Criminal Court later jailed the Election Commissioners.</p>
<p>On 14 July 2006, Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda addressed graduating cadets of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, telling them that the Thai military must serve the king&mdash;not the government.</p>
<p>On 20 July, Bhumibol signed a royal decree endorsing new House elections for 15 October 2006. In an unprecedented act, the King wrote a note on the royal decree calling for a clean and fair election. That very day, Bhumibol underwent spinal surgery.</p>

<p>In 1957, a military coup overthrew the government of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram with allegations of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em>,&nbsp;which is an offense against the dignity of the monarch, punishable under Thai law.&nbsp;This began a new and long-lasting relationship between the monarch and military,leading the king to condone the Thammasat University massacre in defense of his throne, and support a series of military dictatorships.&nbsp;Although Bhumibol did invite public criticism in a 2005 speech,&nbsp;the <em>l&egrave;se majest&eacute;</em> laws have not been revoked by the Thai parliament.</p>
<p><em>Forbes</em> estimated Bhumibol's fortune&mdash;including property and investments managed by the Crown Property Bureau (CPB), a unique body that is neither private nor government-owned&mdash;to be US$30 billion in 2010, and he was the head of the magazine's list of the "world's richest royals" from 2008 to 2013.&nbsp;In May 2014, Bhumibol's wealth was once again listed as US$30 billion.Officially the assets managed by the CPB are owned by the crown as an institution, not Bhumibol Adulyadej as an individual.</p>
<p>After 2006, Bhumibol suffered declining health and spent extended periods at Siriraj Hospital, where he died on 13 October 2016. He was generally highly revered by the people in Thailand&nbsp;&ndash; many even saw him as close to divine.&nbsp;Notable political activists and Thai citizens who criticized the king or the institution of monarchy were often forced to exile the country or suffered frequent imprisonments.</p>
<p>His successor Vajiralongkorn does not share the popularity of his father, leading to concerns that the Thai monarchy will lose prestige and influence under the latter's reign.</p>
<h2><span id="Etymology" class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
<p>Bhumibol's U.S. birth certificate reads simply "<strong>Baby Songkla</strong>", as the parents had to consult his uncle, King Rama VII (Prajadhipok), then head of the House of Chakri, for an auspicious name. The king chose a name of Sanskrit origin, <em>Bhumibol Adulyadej</em> (Devanagari: भूमिबल अतुल्यतेज, <small>IAST</small>: <em>Bhūmibala Atulyateja</em>), a compound of <em>Bhūmi</em> (भूमि), meaning "Land"; <em>Bala</em> (बल), meaning "Strength" or "Power"; <em>Atulya</em> (अतुल्य), meaning "Incomparable"; and <em>Tej</em> (तेज), meaning "Power". Thus, <em>Bhūmibala Atulyateja</em>, or <em>Bhumibol Adulyadej</em> as it is transliterated in Thai, literally means "Strength of the Land, Incomparable Power".</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Bhumibol was born at Cambridge Hospital (now Mount Auburn Hospital) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the United States, on 5 December 1927.&nbsp;He was the youngest son of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla, and his commoner wife Mom Sangwan (later Princess Srinagarindra, the Princess Mother). His father was enrolled in the public health program at Harvard University, which is why Bhumibol was the only monarch to be born in the US.&nbsp;Bhumibol had an older sister, Princess Galyani Vadhana, and an older brother, Prince Ananda Mahidol.</p>
<p>Bhumibol came to Thailand in 1928, after his father obtained a certificate from Harvard. His father died of kidney failure in September 1929, when Bhumibol was less than two years old.&nbsp;He briefly attended Mater Dei school in Bangkok, but in 1933 his mother took her family to Switzerland, where he continued his education at the &Eacute;cole nouvelle de la Suisse romande in Lausanne. In 1934 Bhumibol was given his first camera, which ignited his lifelong enthusiasm for photography.&nbsp;When Bhumibol's childless uncle Prajadhipok abdicated in 1935, his nine-year-old brother Ananda became the new King Rama VIII. However, the family remained in Switzerland and the affairs of the head of state were conducted by a regency council. They returned to Thailand for only two months in 1938. In 1942, Bhumibol became a jazz enthusiast, and started to play the saxophone, a passion that he kept throughout his life.&nbsp;He received the <em>baccalaur&eacute;at des lettres</em> (high-school diploma with a major in French literature, Latin, and Greek) from the Gymnase Classique Cantonal of Lausanne, and by 1945 had begun studying sciences at the University of Lausanne, when World War II ended and the family was able to return to Thailand.</p>

<div class="thumb tleft">
<p>Bhumibol ascended the throne following the death by gunshot wound of his brother, King Ananda Mahidol, on 9 June 1946, under circumstances that remain unclear. While a first government statement stated that Ananda had accidentally shot himself,&nbsp;an investigation committee ruled this was virtually impossible.&nbsp;Two palace aides were eventually convicted of regicide and executed. A third possibility, that Bhumibol accidentally shot his brother while the brothers played with their pistols, was never seriously considered, despite the British official investigation's chronology placing Bhumibol as being the last visitor to the sleeping king's bedroom 20 minutes prior to the shot.</p>
<p>Bhumibol succeeded his brother, but returned to Switzerland before the end of the 100-day mourning period. Despite his interest in science and technology, he changed his major and enrolled in law and political science to prepare for his duties as head of state. His uncle, Rangsit, Prince of Chainat, was appointed Prince Regent. In Bhumibol's name, Prince Rangsit authorized a military coup that overthrew the government of Thamrongnawasawat in November 1947.&nbsp;The regent also signed the 1949 constitution, which returned to the monarchy many of the powers it had lost by the 1932 Revolution.</p>
<p>In December 1946, the Siamese government allocated several hundred thousand dollars for the ceremonial cremation of the remains of the late King Ananda, a necessary preliminary to the coronation of Bhumibol who was required by religious custom to light the funeral pyre. Unsettled conditions in 1947 following a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat resulted in a postponement, and court astrologers determined that March 2, 1949 was the most auspicious date.</p>
<p>While finishing his degree in Switzerland, Bhumibol visited Paris frequently. It was in Paris that he first met Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara, daughter of the Thai ambassador to France (Nakkhatra Mangala) and a great-granddaughter of King Chulalongkorn and thus a cousin of Bhumibol. She was then 15 years old and training to be a concert pianist.</p>
<p>On 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol was driving a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he collided with the rear of a braking truck 10&nbsp;km outside Lausanne. He injured his back, suffered paralysis in half of his face and incurred cuts on his face that cost him the sight of his right eye&nbsp;Both the royal cremation and coronation had to be postponed once more.&nbsp;While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that Bhumibol could get to know her better. Bhumibol selected for her a boarding school in Lausanne, Riante Rive. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949, and they were married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation. Their wedding was described by The New York Times as &ldquo;the shortest, simplest royal wedding ever held in the land of gilded elephants and white umbrellas&rdquo;. The ceremony was performed by Bhumibol's ageing grandmother, Savang Vadhana.</p>
<p>Bhumibol and Sirikit have four children:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Formerly HRH) Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, born 5 April 1951 in Lausanne, Switzerland; married Peter Ladd Jensen (now divorced), and has two daughters. Her son, Bhumi Jensen, was killed in the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.</li>
<li>King Maha Vajiralongkorn, born 28 July 1952; married Mom Luang Soamsawali Kitiyakara (later divorced and became HRH the Princess Niece); one daughter. Then married Yuvadhida Polpraserth (later divorced); four sons and a daughter. Third marriage was to Srirasmi Suwadee (now divorced); one son.</li>
<li>HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, born 2 April 1955; never married, no issue</li>
<li>HRH Princess Chulabhorn Walailak, born 4 July 1957; married Virayudh Tishyasarin, (now divorced); two daughters</li>

Bhumibol at his coronation at the Grand Palace.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>After presiding over the long-delayed, ceremonial cremation of his brother Ananda Mahidol, Bhumibol was crowned King of Thailand on 5 May 1950 in the Baisal Daksin Throne Hall in the Grand Palace in Bangkok. It was the first coronation ceremony of a Thai sovereign to rule under the system of constitutional monarchy.&nbsp;During the ceremony, he pledged that he would "reign with righteousness for the benefit and happiness of the Siamese people" ("เราจะครองแผ่นดินโดยธรรม เพื่อประโยชน์สุขแห่งมหาชนชาวสยาม").&nbsp;Notable elements associated with the coronation included the Bahadrabith Throne beneath the Great White Umbrella of State; and he was presented with the royal regalia and utensils.</p>
<p>In 1950 on Coronation Day, Bhumibol's consort was made Queen (Somdej Phra Boromarajini). The date of his coronation is celebrated each 5 May in Thailand as Coronation Day, a public holiday. On 9 June 2006, Bhumibol celebrated his 60th anniversary as the King of Thailand, becoming the longest reigning monarch in Thai history.</p>
<p>The royal couple spent their honeymoon at Hua Hin beach in southern Thailand before they returned to Switzerland, where the King completed his university studies. They returned to Thailand in 1951.</p>
<p>Following the death of his grandmother Queen Savang Vadhana, Bhumibol entered a 15-day monkhood (22 October 1956&nbsp;&ndash; 5 November 1956) at Wat Bowonniwet, as is customary for Buddhist males on the death of elder relatives. He was ordained by the Supreme Patriarch on 22 October 1956 at the Royal Chapel of the Emerald Buddha in the Grand Palace.&nbsp;During this time, Sirikit was appointed his regent. She was later appointed Queen Regent (Somdej Phra Boromarajininat) in recognition of this.</p>
<p>Although Bhumibol was sometimes referred to as King Rama IX in English, Thais referred to him as <em>Nai Luang</em> or <em>Phra Chao Yu Hua</em> (ในหลวง or พระเจ้าอยู่หัว), which translated to "the King" and "Lord Upon our Heads", respectively. He was also called <em>Chao Chiwit</em> ("Lord of Life").Formally, he was referred to as <em>Phrabat Somdet Phra Chao Yu Hua</em> (พระบาทสมเด็จพระเจ้าอยู่หัว) or, in legal documents, <em>Phrabat Somdet Phra Paraminthara Maha Bhumibol Adulyadej</em> (พระบาทสมเด็จพระปรมินทรมหาภูมิพลอดุลยเดช), and in English as His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. He signed his name as ภูมิพลอดุลยเดช ป.ร. (Bhumibol Adulyadej Por Ror; this is the Thai equivalent of Bhumibol Adulyadej Rex).</p>

Marshal and Mrs. Phibunsongkhram with Eleanor Roosevelt</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the early years of his reign, during the government of military dictator Plaek Phibunsongkhram, Bhumibol had no real political power and was little more than a ceremonial figure under the military-dominated government. In August 1957, six months after parliamentary elections, General Sarit Thanarat accused the government of Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> due to its conduct of the 2,500th anniversary celebration of Buddhism.&nbsp;On 16 September 1957, Phibunsongkhram went to Bhumibol to seek support for his government.&nbsp;Bhumibol advised the field marshal to resign to avoid a coup. Phibunsongkhram refused. That evening, Sarit Thanarat seized power. Two hours later Bhumibol imposed martial law throughout the kingdom.&nbsp;Bhumibol issued a proclamation appointing Sarit as "military defender of the capital" without anyone countersigning the proclamation. It included the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas it appears that the public administration by the government under the premiership of Field Marshal P. Phibunsongkhram is untrustworthy, and that the government could not maintain the public order; and whereas the military, led by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, has successfully taken over the public administration and now acts as the Military Defender of the Capital; now, therefore, I do hereby appoint Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat as the Military Defender of the Capital, and command that all the citizens shall remain calm whilst all the government officers shall serve the orders issued by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat. This Proclamation shall come into force immediately. Done this 16th Day of September, Buddhist Era 2500 (1957).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span id="Sarit_Thanarat_era" class="mw-headline">Sarit Thanarat era</span></h3>
<p>During Sarit's dictatorship, the monarchy was revitalised. Bhumibol attended public ceremonies, toured the provinces and patronised development projects. Under Sarit, the practice of crawling in front of royalty during audiences, banned by King Chulalongkorn, was revived in certain situations and the royal-sponsored Thammayut Nikaya order was revitalised. For the first time since the absolute monarchy was overthrown, a king was conveyed up the Chao Phraya River in a Royal Barge Procession to offer robes at temples.</p>
<p>Other disused ceremonies from the classical period of the Chakri Dynasty, such as the royally patronised ploughing ceremony (Thai: พิธีพืชมงคล), were also revived.Bhumibol's birthday (5 December) was declared the national day, replacing the previous national day, the anniversary of the Siamese revolution of 1932 (24 June).&nbsp;Upon Sarit's death on 8 December 1963, an unprecedented 21 days of mourning were declared in the palace. A royal five-tier umbrella shaded his body while it lay in state. Long-time royal adviser Phraya Srivisarn Vacha later noted that no Prime Minister ever had such an intimate relationship with Bhumibol as Sarit.</p>
<p>Bhumibol biographer Paul Handley, in <em>The King Never Smiles</em>, writes that the dictator Sarit was Bhumibol's tool; political scientist Thak Chaloemtiarana writes that Sarit used Bhumibol in order to build his own credibility.</p>

<p>In 1992, Bhumibol played a key role in Thailand's transition to a democratic system. A coup on 23 February 1991 returned Thailand to military dictatorship. After a general election in 1992, the majority parties invited General Suchinda Kraprayoon, a leader of the coup group, to be prime minister. This caused much dissent, which escalated into demonstrations that led to a large number of deaths when the military was brought in to control protesters. The situation became increasingly critical as police and military forces clashed with protesters. Violence and riots spread to many areas of the capital with rumours of a rift among the armed forces.</p>
<p>Amidst the fear of civil war, Bhumibol intervened. He summoned Suchinda and the leader of the pro-democracy movement, retired Major General Chamlong Srimuang, to a televised audience, and urged them to find a peaceful resolution. At the height of the crisis, the sight of both men appearing together on their knees (in accordance with royal protocol) made a strong impression on the nation, and led to Suchinda's resignation soon afterwards.</p>
<p>It was one of the few occasions in which Bhumibol directly and publicly intervened in a political conflict. A general election was held shortly afterward, leading to a civilian government.</p>

<h3><span id="2003_War_on_Drugs" class="mw-headline">2003 War on Drugs</span></h3>
<p>In his 4 December 2002 speech on the eve of his birthday, King Bhumibol spoke about the rise in drug use, the high social costs and deaths caused by drugs, and called for a "war on drugs".&nbsp;Privy Councillor General Phichit Kunlawanit called on the Thaksin Shinawatra government to use its majority in parliament to establish a special court to deal with drug dealers, stating that "if we execute 60,000 the land will rise and our descendants will escape bad karma".</p>
<p>On 14 January 2003, Thaksin launched a campaign to rid "every square inch of the country" of drugs.&nbsp;His "war on drugs" campaign consisted of setting provincial arrest and seizure quotas including "blacklists", awarding government officials for achieving targets, and threatening punishment for those who failed to make the quota, targeted dealers, and propagated a ruthless carrying out of the campaign. In the first three months, Human Rights Watch reported that 2,275 people were killed, almost double the number normally killed in drug-related violence.&nbsp;Human rights critics claimed a large number were extrajudicially executed.&nbsp;The War on Drugs was widely criticized by the international community.</p>
<p>According to the Narcotics Control Board, the campaign was effective in reducing drug consumption, especially in schools.&nbsp;The War on Drugs was one of the most popular policies of the Thaksin government.&nbsp;Bhumibol, in a 2003 birthday speech, praised Thaksin and criticized those who counted only dead drug dealers while ignoring deaths caused by drugs.</p>
<p>"Victory in the War on Drugs is good. They may blame the crackdown for more than 2,500 deaths, but this is a small price to pay. If the prime minister failed to curb the drug trade, over the years the number of deaths would easily surpass this toll."</p>
<p>Bhumibol also asked the commander of the police to investigate the killings.&nbsp;Police Commander Sant Sarutanond reopened investigations into the deaths, and again claimed that few of the deaths were at the hands of the police.</p>
<p>After the 2006 coup, the military junta appointed a committee led by former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakorn to investigate deaths in the war on drugs.&nbsp;The committee found that over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drug trade and blamed the violence on a government "shoot-to-kill" policy based on flawed blacklists. However, no one has been prosecuted, with interim Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont stating that there was insufficient evidence to take legal action.</p>
<p>While he was opposition leader, Abhisit Vejjajiva accused Thaksin of crimes against humanity in the war on drugs. After he became Prime Minister, Abhisit opened an investigation led by former attorney-general Kampee Kaewcharoen, claiming that a successful probe could lead to prosecution by the International Criminal Court.&nbsp;Abhisit's investigation failed to find or publicize any evidence linking Thaksin or members of his government to extrajudicial killings.</p>

<div class="hatnote">See also: 2005&ndash;06 Thai political crisis</div>
<p>Weeks before the April 2006 legislative election, the Democrat Party-led opposition and the People's Alliance for Democracy petitioned Bhumibol to appoint a replacement prime minister and cabinet. Demands for royal intervention were met with much criticism from the public. Bhumibol, in a speech on 26 April 2006, responded, "Asking for a Royally-appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, pardon me, a mess. It is irrational".</p>
<p>After publicly claiming victory in the boycotted April parliamentary elections, Thaksin Shinawatra had a private audience with the king. A few hours later, Thaksin appeared on national television to announce that he would be taking a break from politics.</p>
<p>In May 2006, the Sondhi Limthongkul-owned <em>Manager Daily</em> newspaper published a series of articles describing the "Finland Plot", alleging that Thaksin and former members of the Communist Party of Thailand planned to overthrow the king and seize control of the nation. No evidence was ever produced to verify the existence of such a plot, and Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai party vehemently denied the accusations and sued the accusers.</p>
<p>In a rare, televised speech to senior judges, Bhumibol requested the judiciary to take action to resolve the political crisis.&nbsp;On 8 May 2006, the Constitutional Court invalidated the results of the April elections and ordered new elections scheduled for 15 October 2006.&nbsp;The Criminal Court later jailed the Election Commissioners.</p>
<p>On 14 July 2006, Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda addressed graduating cadets of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, telling them that the Thai military must serve the king&mdash;not the government.</p>
<p>On 20 July, Bhumibol signed a royal decree endorsing new House elections for 15 October 2006. In an unprecedented act, the King wrote a note on the royal decree calling for a clean and fair election. That very day, Bhumibol underwent spinal surgery.</p>

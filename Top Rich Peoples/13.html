<p><strong>Sergey Mikhaylovich Brin</strong> (Russian: <span lang="ru">Серге́й Миха́йлович Брин</span>; born August 21, 1973) is a Soviet-born American computer scientist, internet entrepreneur, and philanthropist.&nbsp;Together with Larry Page, he co-founded Google. Brin is the President of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. In October 2016 (the most recent period for which figures are available), Brin was the 12th richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$39.2<span class="nowrap">&nbsp;</span>billion.</p>
<p>Brin immigrated to the United States with his family from the Soviet Union at the age of 6. He earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Maryland, following in his father's and grandfather's footsteps by studying mathematics, as well as computer science. After graduation, he moved to Stanford University to acquire a PhD in computer science. There he met Page, with whom he later became friends. They crammed their dormitory room with inexpensive computers and applied Brin's data mining system to build a web search engine. The program became popular at Stanford, and they suspended their PhD studies to start up Google in a rented garage.</p>
<p><em>The Economist</em> referred to Brin as an "Enlightenment Man", and as someone who believes that "knowledge is always good, and certainly always better than ignorance", a philosophy that is summed up by Google's mission statement, "Organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,"&nbsp;and unofficial, sometimes controversial motto, "Don't be evi</p>
<h2><span id="Early_life_and_education" class="mw-headline">Early life and education</span></h2>
<p>Brin was born in Moscow in the Soviet Union, to Russian Jewish parents, Yevgenia and Mikhail Brin, both graduates of Moscow State University (MSU).&nbsp;His father is a mathematics professor at the University of Maryland, and his mother a researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.</p>
<p>In May 1979, when Brin was five years old, his family felt compelled to emigrate out of the Soviet Union.&nbsp;In an interview with Mark Malseed, co-author of <em>The Google Story</em>,&nbsp;Sergey's father explained how he was "forced to abandon his dream of becoming an astronomer even before he reached college." He said "Communist Party heads barred Jews from upper professional ranks by denying them entry to universities, Jews were excluded from the physics department, in particular, at the prestigious Moscow State University, because Soviet leaders did not trust them with nuclear rocket research." Mikhail Brin therefore changed his major to mathematics where he received nearly straight A's.In another interview with Dominic Lawson of <em>The Independent</em>, Mikhail said: "No one would consider me for graduate school because I was Jewish." He went on to tell Lawson how MSU required Jews to take their entrance exams in different rooms from non-Jewish applicants, and how they were marked on a harsher scale.</p>
<p>The Brin family lived in a three-room apartment in central Moscow, which they also shared with Sergey's paternal grandmother.&nbsp;Brin told Malseed, "I've known for a long time that my father wasn't able to pursue the career he wanted", but Brin only picked up the details years later after they had settled in the United States. In 1977, after his father returned from a mathematics conference in Warsaw, Poland, Mikhail Brin announced that it was time for the family to emigrate. "We cannot stay here any more", he told his wife and mother. At the conference, he was able to "mingle freely with colleagues from the United States, France, England and Germany and discovered that his intellectual brethren in the West were not 'monsters.'" He added, "I was the only one in the family who decided it was really important to leave."</p>
<p>Sergey's mother was less willing to leave their home in Moscow, where they had spent their entire lives. Malseed writes, "For Genia, the decision ultimately came down to Sergey. While her husband admits he was thinking as much about his own future as his son's, for her, 'it was 80/20' about Sergey." They formally applied for their exit visa in September 1978, and as a result his father was "promptly fired". For related reasons, his mother also had to leave her job. For the next eight months, without any steady income, they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited, afraid their request would be denied as it was for many refuseniks. During this time his parents shared responsibility for looking after him and his father taught himself computer programming. In May 1979, they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country.</p>
<p>At an interview in October 2000, Brin said, "I know the hard times that my parents went through there and am very thankful that I was brought to the States."&nbsp;In 2017, Brin later recalled: "I came here to the US at age six with my family from the Soviet Union, which was at that time the greatest enemy the US had... It was a dire period, the cold war, as some people remember it. It was under the threat of nuclear annihilation. And even then the US had the courage to take me and my family in as refugees."</p>
<p>In the summer of 1990, a few weeks before his 17th birthday, his father led a group of high school math students, including Sergey, on a two-week exchange program to the Soviet Union. His roommate on the trip was future Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor John Stamper. As Brin recalls, the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority and he remembered that "his first impulse on confronting Soviet oppression had been to throw pebbles at a police car". Malseed adds, "On the second day of the trip, while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near Moscow, Brin took his father aside, looked him in the eye and said, 'Thank you for taking us all out of Russia.'"</p>
<p>Brin attended elementary school at Paint Branch Montessori School in Adelphi, Maryland, but he received further education at home; his father, a professor in the department of mathematics at the University of Maryland, encouraged him to learn mathematics and his family helped him retain his Russian-language skills. He attended Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, Maryland. In September 1990 Brin enrolled in the University of Maryland, where he received his Bachelor of Science from the Department of Computer Science in 1993 with honors in computer science and mathematics, which is part of the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences.</p>
<p>Brin began his graduate study in computer science at Stanford University on a graduate fellowship from the National Science Foundation. In 1993, he interned at Wolfram Research, the developers of Mathematica.&nbsp;As of 2008 he was on leave from his PhD studies at Stanford.</p>

<p>During an orientation for new students at Stanford, he met Larry Page. They seemed to disagree on most subjects. But after spending time together, they "became intellectual soul-mates and close friends". Brin's focus was on developing data mining systems while Page's was in extending "the concept of inferring the importance of a research paper from its citations in other papers".&nbsp;Together, the pair authored a paper titled "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine".</p>
<p>To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub's web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones.&nbsp;The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one Web page to another.</p>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<p>Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network.&nbsp;After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.</p>
<p>Page and Brin used the former's basic HTML programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional servers to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google, still on the Stanford University website, was made available to Internet users..</p>

<p>BackRub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine: a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. Page recalled: "We realized that we had a querying tool. It gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages."&nbsp;Page said that in mid-1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project: "Pretty soon, we had 10,000 searches a day. And we figured, maybe this is really real."</p>
<p>Some compared Page and Brin's vision to the impact of Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of modern printing:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press, printing Bibles for mass consumption. The technology allowed for books and manuscripts&zwj;&mdash;&zwnj;originally replicated by hand&zwj;&mdash;&zwnj;to be printed at a much faster rate, thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the European Renaissance<span class="nowrap">&nbsp;</span>... Google has done a similar job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comparison was also noted by the authors of <em>The Google Story</em>: "Not since Gutenberg<span class="nowrap">&nbsp;</span>... has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google."&nbsp;Also, not long after the two "cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web," such as digitizing books and expanding health information.</p>
<h2><span id="Other_interests" class="mw-headline">Other interests</span></h2>
<p>Brin is working on other, more personal projects that reach beyond Google. For example, he and Page are trying to help solve the world's energy and climate problems at Google's philanthropic arm, Google.org, which invests in the alternative energy industry to find wider sources of renewable energy. The company acknowledges that its founders want "to solve really big problems using technology".</p>
<p>In October 2010, for example, they invested in a major offshore wind power development to assist the East coast power grid,&nbsp;which will eventually become one of about a dozen offshore wind farms that are proposed for the region.&nbsp;A week earlier they introduced a car that, with "artificial intelligence", can drive itself using video cameras and radar sensors.&nbsp;In the future, drivers of cars with similar sensors would have fewer accidents. These safer vehicles could therefore be built lighter and require less fuel consumption.&nbsp;They are trying to get companies to create innovative solutions to increasing the world's energy supply.&nbsp;He is an investor in Tesla Motors,&nbsp;which has developed the Tesla Roadster, a 244-mile (393&nbsp;km) range battery electric vehicle as well as the Tesla Model S, a 265-mile (426&nbsp;km) range battery electric vehicle.</p>
<p>In 2004, he and Page were named "Persons of the Week" by <em>ABC World News Tonight</em>. In January 2005 he was nominated to be one of the World Economic Forum's "Young Global Leaders". In June 2008, Brin invested $4.5 million in Space Adventures, the Virginia-based space tourism company. His investment will serve as a deposit for a reservation on one of Space Adventures' proposed flights in 2011. Space Adventures, the only company that sends tourists to space, has sent five of them so far.</p>
<p>Brin and Page jointly own a customized Boeing 767-200 and a Dornier Alpha Jet,&nbsp;and pay $1.3 million a year to house them and two Gulfstream V jets owned by Google executives at Moffett Federal Airfield. The aircraft have had scientific equipment installed by NASA to allow experimental data to be collected in flight.</p>
<p>In 2012, Brin has been involved with the Project Glass program and has demoed eyeglass prototypes. Project Glass is a research and development program by Google to develop an augmented reality head-mounted display (HMD).&nbsp;The intended purpose of Project Glass products would be the hands-free displaying of information currently available to most smartphone users,&nbsp;and allowing for interaction with the Internet via natural language voice commands.</p>
<p>Brin was also involved in the Google driverless car project. In September 2012, at the signing of the California Driverless Vehicle Bill,&nbsp;Brin predicted that within five years, robotic cars will be available to the general public.</p>
<p>Brin is a supporter of lab-grown meat and kite-energy systems.</p>
<p><em>The Economist</em> magazine describes Brin's approach to life, like Page's, as based on a vision summed up by Google's motto, "of making all the world's information 'universally accessible and useful'".</p>
<h2><span id="Censorship_of_Google_in_China" class="mw-headline">Censorship of Google in China</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote">For more details on this topic, see Censorship in the People's Republic of China.</div>
<p>Remembering his youth and his family's reasons for leaving the Soviet Union, he "agonized over Google's decision to appease the Communist government of China by allowing it to censor search engine results", but he decided that the Chinese would still be better off than without having Google available.</p>
<p>On January 12, 2010, Google reported a large cyber attack on its computers and corporate infrastructure that began a month earlier, which included accessing two Gmail accounts and the theft of Google's intellectual property. After the attack was determined to have originated in China, the company stated that it would no longer agree to censor its search engine in China and may exit the country altogether. David Drummond, Google's Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, reported that "a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists, but that the attack also targeted 20 other large companies in the finance, technology, media and chemical sectors."&nbsp;It was later reported that the attack had also targeted "one of Google's crown jewels, a password system that controls access by millions of users worldwide".</p>
<p>In late March 2010, it officially discontinued its China-based search engine while keeping its uncensored Hong Kong site in operation. Speaking for Google, Brin stated during an interview, "One of the reasons I am glad we are making this move in China is that the China situation was really emboldening other countries to try and implement their own firewalls."&nbsp;During another interview with <em>Der Spiegel</em>, he added, "For us it has always been a discussion about how we can best fight for openness on the Internet. We believe that this is the best thing that we can do for preserving the principles of the openness and freedom of information on the Internet."</p>
<p>Senator Byron Dorgan stated that "Google's decision is a strong step in favor of freedom of expression and information." And Congressman Bob Goodlatte said, "I applaud Google for its courageous step to stop censoring search results on Google.cn. Google has drawn a line in the sand and is shining a light on the very dark area of individual liberty restrictions in China."&nbsp;From the business perspective, many recognize that the move is likely to affect Google's profits. <em>The New Republic</em> adds that "Google seems to have arrived at the same link that was obvious to Andrei Sakharov: the one between science and freedom," referring to the move as "heroism,'</p>

<p><strong>Michael Rubens</strong> "<strong>Mike</strong>" <strong>Bloomberg</strong>&nbsp;(born February 14, 1942) is an American businessman, author, politician, and philanthropist. His net worth is estimated at US$46.5 billion, as of February 2017, ranking him as the 6th richest person in the United States and the 8th richest person in the world.</p>
<p>Bloomberg is the founder, CEO, and owner of Bloomberg L.P., a global financial services, mass media, and software company that bears his name, and is notable for its Bloomberg Terminal, a computer software system providing financial data widely used in the global financial services industry. He began his career at the securities brokerage Salomon Brothers, before forming his own company in 1981 and spending the next twenty years as its chairman and CEO. Bloomberg also served as chairman of the board of trustees at his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, from 1996 to 2002.</p>
<p>Bloomberg served as the 108th Mayor of New York City, holding office for three consecutive terms, beginning with his first election in 2001. A Democrat before seeking elective office, Bloomberg switched his party registration in 2001 to run for Mayor as a Republican. He defeated opponent Mark Green in a close election held just weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks. He won a second term in 2005, and left the Republican Party two years later. Bloomberg campaigned to change the city's term limits law, and was elected to his third term in 2009 as an Independent candidate on the Republican ballot line.</p>
<p>Bloomberg was frequently mentioned as a possible candidate for the U.S. Presidential elections in 2008, and 2012, as well as for Governor of New York in 2010. He declined to seek either office, opting to continue serving as the Mayor of New York City.</p>
<p>On January 1, 2014, Bill de Blasio succeeded Bloomberg as the Mayor of New York City. After a brief stint as a full-time philanthropist, Bloomberg re-assumed the position of CEO at Bloomberg L.P. by the end of 2014. On March 7, 2016, Bloomberg announced that he would not run as a third party candidate in the 2016 U.S. presidential election despite widespread speculation that he would, and later endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for president.</p>
<h2><span id="Early_life" class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Michael Bloomberg was born at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, in the Brighton neighborhood of Boston, on February 14, 1942.&nbsp;Bloomberg's family is Jewish. Bloomberg's father, William Henry Bloomberg (1906&ndash;1963), was a bookkeeper for a dairy company and the son of Alexander "Elick" Bloomberg, an immigrant from Russia. His mother, Charlotte (Rubens) Bloomberg (January 2, 1909 &ndash; June 19, 2011), was a native of Jersey City, New Jersey.</p>
<p>His maternal grandfather, Max Rubens, was an immigrant from present-day Belarus, then also part of Russia.</p>
<p>The family lived in Allston, Massachusetts, until Bloomberg was two years old, when they moved to Brookline for the next two years, finally settling in Medford, a Boston suburb, where he lived until after he graduated from college.</p>
<p>Bloomberg is an Eagle Scout.</p>
<p>Bloomberg attended Johns Hopkins University, where he joined the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. In 1962, as a sophomore, he constructed the school's mascot, the blue jay. He graduated in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering. In 1966 he graduated from Harvard Business School as a Master of Business Administration.</p>
<p>In 1973, Bloomberg became a general partner at Salomon Brothers, a bulge-bracket Wall Street investment bank, where he headed equity trading and, later, systems development. In 1981, Salomon Brothers was bought&nbsp;by Phibro Corporation, and Bloomberg was laid off from the investment bank. &nbsp;He was given no severance package, but owned $10 million worth of equity as a partner at the firm.</p>
<p>Using this money, Bloomberg went on to set up a company named Innovative Market Systems. His business plan was based on the realization that Wall Street (and the financial community generally) was willing to pay for high-quality business information, delivered as quickly as possible and in as many usable forms possible, via technology (e.g., graphs of highly specific trends).</p>
<p>In 1982, Merrill Lynch became the new company's first customer, installing 22 of the company's Market Master terminals and investing $30 million in the company. The company was renamed Bloomberg L.P. in 1987.&nbsp;By 1990, it had installed 8,000 terminals.&nbsp;Over the years, ancillary products including Bloomberg News, Bloomberg Message, and Bloomberg Tradebook were launched.</p>
<p>As of October 2015, the company had more than 325,000 terminal subscribers worldwide.&nbsp;His company also has a radio network which currently has 1130 WBBR AM in New York City as its flagship station. He left the position of CEO to pursue a political career as the mayor of New York City. Bloomberg was replaced as CEO by Lex Fenwick..&nbsp;During Bloomberg's three mayoral terms, the company was led by president Daniel L. Doctoroff, a former deputy mayor under Bloomberg.</p>
<p>After completing his final term as the mayor of New York City, Bloomberg spent his first eight months out of office as a full-time philanthropist. In the fall of 2014, he announced that he would return to Bloomberg L.P. as CEO at the end of 2014,&nbsp;succeeding Doctoroff, who had led the company since retiring from the Bloomberg administration in February 2008.&nbsp;Bloomberg remains the CEO of Bloomberg L.P.</p>
<p>previous year, enjoying the world's biggest increase in wealth in 2009.02. He won re-election in 2005 and again in 2009. As mayor, Bloomberg initially struggled to gain high approval levels from the public; however, he subsequently developed and maintained high approval ratings.&nbsp;His re-election meant the Republicans had won the previous four mayoral elections (although Bloomberg's decision to leave the Republican Party and be declared an independent on June 19, 2007, resulted in the Republican Party's losing the mayor's seat prior to the expiration of his second term). Bloomberg joined Rudy Giuliani and Fiorello La Guardia as re-elected Republican mayors in the mostly Democratic city. (John Lindsay was also elected mayor of New York City twice while a registered Republican; however, Lindsay did not receive the Republican Party nomination during his 1969 campaign for re-election but ran successfully on the Liberal ticket and joined the Democratic Party during his second term.)</p>
<p>At that time, there were only four fortunes in the U.S. that were larger (although the Wal-Mart family fortune is split among four people). He had moved from 142nd to 17th in the <em>Forbes</em> list of the world's billionaires in only two years (March 2007 &ndash; March 2009).&nbsp;In September 2013, Forbes reported Bloomberg's wealth as $33 billion and ranked him as the 13th richest person in the world. In March 2012, Forbes reported Bloomberg's wealth at $22 billion, ranking him 20th in the world and 11th in the United States.&nbsp;In September 2015, his net worth was $43.3 billion, ranking him the 6th richest person in the United States.</p>
<p>Bloomberg is a member of Kappa Beta Phi.&nbsp;He wrote an autobiography, with help from Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief Matthew Winkler, called <em>Bloomberg by Bloomberg</em>.</p>

<p>Bloomberg assumed office as the 108th Mayor of New York City on January 1, 20</p>
<p>Bloomberg stated that he wanted public education reform to be the legacy of his first term and addressing poverty to be the legacy of his second.&nbsp;According to the National Assessment of Educational Performance, fourth-grade reading scores from 2002-09 rose nationally by 11 points. However, on May 10, 2010, <em>The New York Times</em> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the test NAEP, New York City eighth graders have shown no significant improvement in math or reading since they began taking it in 2003, mirroring the largely flat performance of American eighth graders as a whole during that period. In the city, the lack of improvement held true across ethnic groups and also among lower-income students.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some activists (including Diane Ravitch) opposed Bloomberg's reforms, claiming his approach to the New York City education system was largely unsuccessful because of skewed numbers. Under the reformed approach, a school had to have done better than the previous year to receive funding. Due to this requirement, it was alleged that many successful schools were closed for being "unsuccessful" based on their inability to raise test scores, even though they were top performing schools, while many unsuccessful schools received the bulk of funding for simply raising their scores slightly.</p>
<p>Bloomberg has chosen to apply a statistical, results-based approach to city management, appointing city commissioners based on their expertise and granting them wide autonomy in their decision-making. Breaking with 190 years of tradition, he implemented what <em>New York Times</em> political reporter Adam Nagourney called a "bullpen" open office plan, similar to a Wall Street trading floor, in which dozens of aides and managerial staff are seated together in a large chamber. The design is intended to promote accountability and accessibility.</p>
<p>d Avenue Subway; on December 20, 2013, Bloomberg took a ceremonial ride on a train to the new 34th Street station to celebrate a part of his legacy as mayor,</p>
<p>In efforts to create "cutbacks" in the New York City Spending Bracket, Bloomberg declined to receive a city salary. He accepted a remuneration of $1 annually for his services.He maintains a public listing in the New York City phone directory,&nbsp;and during his term as mayor, he lived not in Gracie Mansion &ndash; the official mayoral residence &ndash; but instead at his own home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He also has homes in London, Bermuda and Vail, Colorado.</p>
<p>Bloomberg stated that during his mayoralty, he rode the New York City Subway on a daily basis, particularly in the commute from his 79th Street home to his office at City Hall. An August 2007 story in <em>The New York Times</em> stated that he was often seen chauffeured by two New York Police Department-owned SUVs to an express train station to avoid having to change from the local to the express trains on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.</p>
<p>He supports the construction of the 7 Subway Extension and the Secon</p>

<h3><span id="Environmental_advocacy" class="mw-headline">Environmental advocacy</span></h3>
<p>Bloomberg is a dedicated environmentalist and has advocated policy to fight climate change at least since he became the mayor of New York City. At the national level, Bloomberg has consistently pushed for transitioning the United States&rsquo; energy mix from fossil fuels to clean energy. In July 2011, Bloomberg donated $50 million through Bloomberg Philanthropies to Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign, allowing the campaign to expand its efforts to shut down coal-fired power plants from 15 states to 45 states.&nbsp;On April 8, 2015, to build on the success of the Beyond Coal campaign, Bloomberg announced an additional Bloomberg Philanthropies investment of $30 million in the Beyond Coal initiative, matched with another $30 million by other donors, to help secure the retirement of half of America's fleet of coal plants by 2017.</p>
<p>Bloomberg awarded a $6 million grant through Bloomberg Philanthropies to the Environmental Defense Fund in support of strict regulations on fracking in the 14 states with the heaviest natural gas production.</p>
<p>In October 2013, Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies launched the Risky Business initiative with former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and hedge-fund billionaire Tom Steyer. The joint effort worked to convince the business community of the need for more sustainable energy and development policies by quantifying and publicized the economic risks the United States faces from the impacts of climate change.&nbsp;In January 2015, Bloomberg led Bloomberg Philanthropies in a $48 million partnership with the Heising-Simons family to launch the Clean Energy Initiative. The initiative supports state-based solutions aimed at ensuring America has a clean, reliable, and affordable energy system.</p>
<p>Since 2010, Bloomberg has taken an increasingly global role on environmental issues. From 2010-13, he served as the chairman of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, a network of the world's biggest cities working together to reduce carbon emissions.During his tenure, Bloomberg worked with President Bill Clinton to merge C40 with the Clinton Climate Initiative, with the goal of amplifying their efforts in the global fight against climate change worldwide.&nbsp;He serves as the President of the Board of C40 Cities.&nbsp;In January 2014, Bloomberg began a five-year commitment totaling $53 million through Bloomberg Philanthropies to the Vibrant Oceans Initiative. The initiative partners Bloomberg Philanthropies with Oceana, Rare, and Encourage Capital to help reform fisheries and increase sustainable populations worldwide.</p>
<p>On January 31, 2014, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon appointed Bloomberg as his first Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change to help the United Nations work with cities to prevent climate change.&nbsp;In September 2014, Bloomberg convened with Ban and global leaders at the UN Climate Summit to announce definite actions to fight climate change in 2015.</p>
<p>In late 2014, Bloomberg, Ban Ki-moon, and global city networks ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI), C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), with support from UN-Habitat, launched the Compact of Mayors, a global coalition of mayors and city officials pledging to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, enhance resilience to climate change, and track their progress transparently.&nbsp;To date, over 250 cities representing more than 300 million people worldwide and 4.1% of the total global population, have committed to the Compact of Mayors,&nbsp;which was merged with the Covenant of Mayors in June 2016.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2015, Bloomberg and mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo jointly announced the creation of the Climate Summit for Local Leaders, which convened on December 4, 2015.&nbsp;The Climate Summit assembled hundreds of city leaders from around the world at Paris City Hall,&nbsp;marking the largest recorded gathering of local leaders on the subject of fighting climate change.&nbsp;The Summit concluded with the presentation of the Paris Declaration, a pledge by leaders from assembled global cities to cut carbon emissions by 3.7 gigatons annually by 2030.</p>
<p>During the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and chair of the Financial Stability Board, announced that Bloomberg will lead a new global task force designed to help industry and financial markets understand the growing risks of climate change.</p>
<p>Bloomberg and former Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope are expected to co-author a book on climate change &ldquo;Climate of Hope: How Cities, Businesses, and Citizens Can Save the Planet,&rdquo; to be published by St. Martin&rsquo;s Press.</p>

<p>In late 2014, Bloomberg, Ban Ki-moon, and global city networks ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI), C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), with support from UN-Habitat, launched the Compact of Mayors, a global coalition of mayors and city officials pledging to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, enhance resilience to climate change, and track their progress transparently.&nbsp;To date, over 250 cities representing more than 300 million people worldwide and 4.1% of the total global population, have committed to the Compact of Mayors,&nbsp;which was merged with the Covenant of Mayors in June 2016.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2015, Bloomberg and mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo jointly announced the creation of the Climate Summit for Local Leaders, which convened on December 4, 2015.&nbsp;The Climate Summit assembled hundreds of city leaders from around the world at Paris City Hall,&nbsp;marking the largest recorded gathering of local leaders on the subject of fighting climate change.&nbsp;The Summit concluded with the presentation of the Paris Declaration, a pledge by leaders from assembled global cities to cut carbon emissions by 3.7 gigatons annually by 2030.</p>
<p>During the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and chair of the Financial Stability Board, announced that Bloomberg will lead a new global task force designed to help industry and financial markets understand the growing risks of climate change.</p>
<p>Bloomberg and former Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope are expected to co-author a book on climate change &ldquo;Climate of Hope: How Cities, Businesses, and Citizens Can Save the Planet,&rdquo; to be published by St. Martin&rsquo;s Press.</p>

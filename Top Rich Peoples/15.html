<h2><span id="Early_life_and_family" class="mw-headline">Early life and family</span></h2>
<p>Jim Walton was born in Newport, Jackson County, Arkansas, the third child of Wal-Mart co-founder Sam Walton (1918&ndash;1992) and Helen Walton (1919&ndash;2007), with siblings Rob Walton, Alice Walton, and John Walton (d. 2005).&nbsp;After graduating from Bentonville High School in 1965 where he was president of his junior class, played football at all-state level and also learned to fly a plane, Walton received a bachelor's degree in Business Administration (BA) Marketing from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas in 1971, where he was also a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.&nbsp;In 1972, he joined Wal-Mart and was involved in its real estate dealings.

<p>In September 2003, Allen launched the Allen Institute for Brain Science with a $100&nbsp;million contribution dedicated to understanding how the human brain works. In total, Paul Allen has donated $500&nbsp;million to the institute, making it his single largest philanthropic recipient. Since its launch, the Allen Institute for Brain Science has taken a Big Science and Open Science approach to tackle projects. The institute makes research tools available to the scientific community using an open data model.&nbsp;Some of the institute's most notable projects include the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, Allen Human Brain Atlas and the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas. The Allen Institute is also helping to advance and shape the White House's BRAIN Initiative as well as the Human Brain Project.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) main focus is to research and engineer artificial intelligence.&nbsp;The Institute is modeled after the Allen Institute for Brain Science and led by researcher and professor, Dr. Oren Etzioni. AI2 has undertaken four main projects, Aristo, Semantic Scholar, Euclid and Plato. Project Aristo is working to build an AI system capable of passing an 8th grade science exam.</p>
<p>In December 2014, Allen committed $100&nbsp;million to create the Allen Institute for Cell Science in Seattle. The institute is investigating and creating a virtual model of cells in the hope of bringing forth treatment of different diseases.Like the institutes before it, all data generated and tools developed will be made publicly available online.</p>
<p>Launched in 2016 with a $100&nbsp;million commitment, The Paul G. Allen Frontiers Group aims to discover and support ideas at the frontier of bioscience in an effort accelerate the pace of discovery.&nbsp;The group is led by Tom Skalak and will be targeting scientists and research areas that &Prime;some might consider out-of-the-box at the very edges of knowledge.&Prime;</p>
<p>Allen launched the Allen Distinguished Investigators Awards (ADI) in 2010 to support scientists pursuing early-stage research projects who often have difficulty securing funding from traditional sources.The ADI grant program backs pioneering researchers in the areas of emerging life sciences technology to cellular decision-making and neural engineering with the intent that research made possible by these grants will advance each respective field.</p>
<p>Paul Allen donated the seed money to build SETI's Allen Telescope Array, eventually contributing $30&nbsp;million to the project.</p>

<h3><span id="Environment_and_conservation" class="mw-headline">Environment and conservation</span></h3>
<p>Allen has bankrolled a range of wildlife conservation projects over the past several years, including contributing millions in direct gifts and grants to program, projects, initiatives and charities. By marrying technology development with philanthropic interests, he is working to address the trafficking of endangered species and ensure stable or thriving generations of wild animals.</p>
<p>Allen provided more than $7&nbsp;million to fund the census, the largest pan-African aerial survey since the 1970s. The Great Elephant Census team is flying over 20 countries to survey the African savannah elephants with hopes that the accurate and up-to-date data will spur immediate protective actions and long-term conservation management plans.</p>
<p>Allen began supporting the University of British Columbia's Sea Around Us Project in 2014 to improve data on global fisheries as a way to fight illegal fishing. Part of his $2.6&nbsp;million in funding will go to create FishBase,&nbsp;an online database about adult finfish.</p>
<p>Launched in July 2015, Paul Allen is funding the Global FinPrint initiative, a three-year survey of sharks and rays in coral reef areas. The survey is the largest of its kind and designed to provide data to help conservation programs. The initiative is a partnership between Allen's Vulcan Inc, Stony Brook University, Florida International University, James Cook University and the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences. Survey results will be made available in summer 2018.</p>
<p>Allen backed Washington state initiative 1401 to prohibit the purchase, sale and distribution of products made from 10 endangered species including elephants, rhinos, lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, marine turtles, pangolins, sharks and rays. The initiative gained enough signatures to be on the state's ballot on November 3, 2015, and passed.</p>
<p>Alongside the United States Department of Transportation, Allen and Vulcan Inc. launched the Smart City Challenge,&nbsp;a contest inviting American cities to transform their transportation systems. Created in 2015 with USDOT's $40&nbsp;million commitment as well as $10&nbsp;million from Allen's Vulcan Inc., the challenge aims to create a first-of-its-kind modern city that will demonstrate how cities can improve quality of life while lowering greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;The winning city will be named in June 2016.</p>
<p>Created in 2015, the Smart Catch program is designed for chefs by chefs to recognize and promote restaurants serving sustainable seafood. The program right now is being used by over 80 restaurants in Seattle.</p>
<p>As a founding member of the International SeaKeepers Society, Paul Allen hosts its proprietary SeaKeeper 1000TM oceanographic and atmospheric monitoring system on all three of his megayachts.</p>

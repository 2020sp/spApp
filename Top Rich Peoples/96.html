<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Philip Anschutz</h1>
<p><strong>Philip Frederick Anschutz</strong> (<span class="nowrap"><span class="IPA nopopups">/<span title="/ˈ/ primary stress follows">ˈ</span><span title="/&aelig;/ short 'a' in 'bad'">&aelig;</span><span title="'n' in 'no'">n</span><span title="/ʃ/ 'sh' in 'shy'">ʃ</span><span title="/uː/ long 'oo' in 'food'">uː</span><span title="'t' in 'tie'">t</span><span title="'s' in 'sigh'">s</span>/</span></span> <span title="English pronunciation respelling"><em><strong><span class="smallcaps">an</span></strong>-shoots</em></span>; born December 28, 1939) is an American entrepreneur. Anschutz bought out his father's drilling company, Circle A Drilling, in 1961 and earned large returns in Wyoming. He has invested in stocks, real estate and railroads. He then began investing in entertainment companies, co-founding Major League Soccer as well as multiple teams, including the Los Angeles Galaxy, Chicago Fire, Houston Dynamo, San Jose Earthquakes, and the New York/New Jersey MetroStars. Anschutz owns stakes in the Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Kings, and venues including the Staples Center, The O2, London, and the StubHub Center. Anschutz also invests in family films such as <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> and <em>Ray</em>. Forbes ranks him the 38th richest person in the U.S. with an estimated net worth of $11 billion as of 2014.</p>
<h2><span id="Life_and_career" class="mw-headline">Life and career</span></h2>
<p>Anschutz was born in Russell, Kansas, the son of Marian (n&eacute;e Pfister) and Frederick Benjamin Anschutz.&nbsp;He has one older sister, Sue Anschutz-Rodgers, who became a Colorado rancher and philanthropist.&nbsp;His father was an oil tycoon and land investor who invested in ranches in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, and eventually went into the oil-drilling business. Carl Anschutz&nbsp;Anschutz's grandfather, an ethnic German who emigrated from Russia, started the Farmers State Bank in Russell, Kansas. Anschutz grew up in Russell, Wichita, and Hays, Kansas, where he lived near Bob Dole. In later years, Anschutz contributed to Dole's political campaigns. He graduated from Wichita High School East in 1957, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in business from the University of Kansas in 1961 where he was a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity.&nbsp;His first cousin was the fellow Russell native and long-time news anchor Wendall Anschutz.&nbsp;A member of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, he is a conservative Christian.&nbsp;He and his wife Nancy, whom he met when he was 16, have three children. Anschutz was inducted into the Kansas Business Hall of Fame in 2000&nbsp;and the U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2002.</p>
<p>Anschutz is a somewhat reclusive man who prefers to stay out of the limelight. He has granted only three formal interviews since 1979, and none at all from the 1980s until 2015.&nbsp;On December 6, 2015, Anschutz broke his media silence when he appeared with several of the founders of Major League Soccer to reflect on the league's 20-year anniversary.</p>
<h3><span id="Land_ownership" class="mw-headline">Land ownership</span></h3>
<p>In 1970, Anschutz bought the 250,000-acre (1,000&nbsp;km&sup2;) Baughman Farms, one of the country's largest farming corporations, in Liberal, Kansas, for $10 million. The following year, he acquired 9 million acres (36,000&nbsp;km&sup2;) along the Utah-Wyoming border. This produced his first fortune in the oil business.&nbsp;In the early 1980s, the Anschutz Ranch, with its 1 billion barrel (160,000,000 m&sup3;) oil pocket, became the largest oil field discovery in the United States since Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 1968. He sold an interest in it to Mobil Oil for $500 million in 1982.</p>
<p>For several years, Anschutz was Colorado's sole billionaire. With his acquisition of land in other Western states, he owns more land than most other private citizens in the United States.</p>
<p>Anschutz then moved into railroads and telecommunications before venturing into the entertainment industry. In 1999, <em>Fortune</em> magazine compared him to the nineteenth-century tycoon J.P. Morgan, as both men "struck it rich in a fundamentally different way: they operated across an astounding array of industries, mastering and reshaping entire economic landscapes."</p>
<h3><span id="Rail_and_petroleum_businesses" class="mw-headline">Rail and petroleum businesses</span></h3>
<p>In 1984 he entered the railroad business by purchasing the Rio Grande Railroad's holding company, Rio Grande Industries. Four years later in 1988, the Rio Grande railroad purchased the Southern Pacific Railroad under his direction. With the merger of the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific Corporation in September 1996, Anschutz became Vice-Chairman of Union Pacific. Prior to the merger, he was a director of Southern Pacific from June 1988 to September 1996, and non-executive chairman of Southern Pacific from 1993 to September 1996. He was also a director of Forest Oil Corporation beginning in 1995. In November 1993 he became Director and Chairman of the Board of Qwest, stepping down as a nonexecutive co-chairman in 2002 but remaining on the board. He has also been a director for Pacific Energy Partners and served on the boards of the American Petroleum Institute, in Washington, D.C. and the National Petroleum Council in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>In May 2001, the Bush administration upheld Anschutz's right to drill an exploratory oil well at Weatherman Draw in south-central Montana where Native American tribes wanted to preserve sacred rock drawings. Environmental groups, preservationists, and ten Native American tribes had appealed the decision without success. In April 2002, the Anschutz Exploration Corporation gave up its plans to drill for oil in the area. They donated its leases for oil and gas rights to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which has pledged to let the leases expire, and the Bureau of Land Management said it had no plans to permit further leases there and would consider formal withdrawal of the 4,268 acre (17&nbsp;km&sup2;) site from mineral leasing in its 2004 management plan. In recognition of its preservation efforts, The National Trust for Historic Preservation presented its President's Award to the Anschutz Exploration Corporation</p>
<p>In May 2003, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer reached a settlement with Anschutz after the AG filed a civil complaint accusing Anschutz of accepting IPO shares from Salomon Smith Barney in exchange for Qwest's investment banking business. Anschutz denied any wrongdoing but volunteered to donate a total of $4.4 million to settle the case as long as he selected the recipient organizations in advance.&nbsp;Anschutz paid $100,000 to each of 32 New York nonprofit philanthropic groups, as well as $200,000 to each of six law schools. In return, Spitzer dropped his civil suit.&nbsp;The payment was roughly equal to his profit from the practice of IPO "spinning"; thus, he actually suffered no penalty. The suit by Spitzer was panned in a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> editorial headlined, "The Anschutz Ransom".&nbsp;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice extensively investigated Qwest officials and determined there was no justification for taking action against any board member. The <em>Denver Post</em> summarized the implications for Anschutz: "Not only is Qwest founder and board member Philip Anschutz not a defendant in the long-awaited civil case against the regime of former Qwest chief executive Joe Nacchio, he doesn't even merit a mention in the 50-page complaint."</p>
<p>In February 2006, the Denver <em>Rocky Mountain News</em> reported that Anschutz would not stand for re-election to the boards of Qwest and Union Pacific and would resign from the board of Regal Entertainment Group so he could focus on his other investments.</p>
<p>On June 24, 2008, it was announced that Anschutz would buy Xanterra Parks and Resorts, which had purchased the Grand Canyon Railway in 2007.&nbsp;In 2011, it was announced that Anschutz purchased the Oklahoma Publishing Company, and as part of their assets the Broadmoor and the Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway in Colorado Springs.</p>
<p>Effective August 1, 2010, Xanterra Parks and Resorts purchased and assumed management of Kingsmill Resort. Xanterra purchased the resort from Busch Properties, Inc. (BPI).</p>
<h3><span id="Entertainment_-_Anschutz_Entertainment_Group" class="mw-headline">Entertainment - Anschutz Entertainment Group</span></h3>
<p>The Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) is a sporting and music entertainment presenter and a subsidiary of The Anschutz Corporation. It is the owner of entertainment venues and under AEG Live the world's second largest presenter of live music and entertainment events after Live Nation.</p>
<p>On September 18, 2012, Anschutz announced he was putting AEG up for sale but decided not to accept&nbsp;any of the bids, and on March 14 he took AEG off the market.</p>
<h3><span id="Soccer" class="mw-headline">Soccer</span></h3>
<p>Anschutz is one of only four recipients of the National Soccer Hall of Fame's Medal of Honor for his contributions to growing the sport of soccer in the United States.&nbsp;Sports Business Journal ranked Anschutz in 2006 as the #1 most influential person in soccer in the U.S.&nbsp;Anschutz was one of the founders of Major League Soccer as well as multiple teams, including the Los Angeles Galaxy, Chicago Fire, Colorado Rapids, Houston Dynamo, San Jose Earthquakes, D.C. United, and the New York/New Jersey MetroStars.He owns a stake in the StubHub Center, the stadium for the MLS team LA Galaxy and former MLS team Chivas USA. For some time, while MLS was struggling, Anschutz owned six MLS franchises and experienced significant financial losses. For this reason, Anschutz has been called the man who saved MLS.&nbsp;MLS Commissioner Don Garber stated in 2006 that "without Phil Anschutz, there's no MLS today."</p>
<p>Anschutz was instrumental in several MLS initiatives that have grown the league's revenues and profits. For example, Anschutz pushed for the building of soccer-specific stadiums, allowing MLS teams to increase revenue and better control costs.&nbsp;Anschutz also advocated for MLS' creation of Soccer United Marketing, the league's sales and marketing arm.&nbsp;Anschutz has since sold his stake in the Chicago, Denver, Houston, New York, San Jose and D.C. MLS teams and currently only owns the Galaxy</p>

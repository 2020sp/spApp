<p><strong>Warren Edward Buffett</strong> (<span class="nowrap"><span class="IPA nopopups">/<span title="/ˈ/ primary stress follows">ˈ</span><span title="'b' in 'buy'">b</span><span title="/ʌ/ short 'u' in 'bud'">ʌ</span><span title="'f' in 'find'">f</span><span title="/ɪ/ or /ə/ 'e' in 'roses'">ᵻ</span><span title="'t' in 'tie'">t</span>/</span></span>; born August 30, 1930)&nbsp;is an American investor, business magnate, and philanthropist. He is considered by some to be one of the most successful investors in the world,&nbsp;and as of February 2017 is the second wealthiest person in the United States with a total net worth of $76.9 billion.</p>
<p>Born in Omaha, Buffet developed an interest in investing in his youth, eventually entering the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 before transferring and graduating from University of Nebraska&ndash;Lincoln. After graduating at 19, Buffet enrolled at Columbia Business School of Columbia University, learning and eventually creating his investment philosophy around a concept pioneered by Benjamin Graham&ndash;value investing. He attended New York Institute of Finance to specialize his economics background and soon after began various business partnerships, including one with Graham. After meeting Charlie Munger, Buffet created the Buffett Partnership. His firm would eventually acquire a textile manufacturing firm called Berkshire Hathaway and assume its name to create a diversified holding company.</p>
<p>Buffet has been the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway since 1970,&nbsp;and his business exploits have had him referred to as the "Wizard", "Oracle" or "Sage" of Omaha by global media outlets.&nbsp;He is noted for his adherence to value investing and for his personal frugality despite his immense wealth.</p>
<p>Buffett is a notable philanthropist, having pledged to give away 99 percent<span style="font-size: xx-small;">.</span>&nbsp;of his fortune to philanthropic causes, primarily via the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. He is also active in contributing to political causes, having endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election;&nbsp;he has publicly opposed the policies, actions, and statements of the current U.S. president, Donald Trump</p>
<h2><span id="Early_life_and_education" class="mw-headline">Early life and education</span></h2>
<p>Buffett was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska. He was the second of three children and the only son of Leila (n&eacute;e Stahl) and Congressman Howard Buffett,<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference">[12]</sup> Buffett began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School. In 1942, his father was elected to the first of four terms in the United States Congress, and after moving with his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: "likes math; a future stockbroker."&nbsp;After finishing high school and finding success with his side entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into business, but was overruled by his father</p>
<p>Buffett displayed an interest in business and investing at a young age. Much of Buffett's early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. One of his first business ventures, Buffett sold chewing gum, Coca-Cola bottles, or weekly magazines door to door. He worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. On his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route.&nbsp;In 1945, as a high school sophomore, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used pinball machine, which they placed in the local barber shop. Within months, they owned several machines in three different barber shops across Omaha. The business was sold later in the year for $1,200 to a war veteran.</p>

</div>
<p>Buffett's interest in the stock market and investing dated to schoolboy days he spent in the customers' lounge of a regional stock brokerage near his father's own brokerage office. On a trip to New York City at age ten, he made a point to visit the New York Stock Exchange. At 11, he bought three shares of Cities Service Preferred for himself, and three for his sister Doris Buffett (founder of The Sunshine Lady Foundation).&nbsp;At the age of 15, Warren made more than $175 monthly delivering <em>Washington Post</em> newspapers. In high school, he invested in a business owned by his father and bought a 40-acre farm worked by a tenant farmer. He bought the land when he was 14 years old with $1,200 of his savings. By the time he finished college, Buffett had accumulated $9,800 in savings (about $99,000 today)</p>
<p>In 1947, Buffett entered the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He would have preferred to focus on his business ventures; however, he enrolled due to pressure from his father.&nbsp;Warren studied there for two years and joined the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.He then transferred to the University of Nebraska&ndash;Lincoln where at 19, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. After being rejected by Harvard Business School, Buffett enrolled at Columbia Business School of Columbia University upon learning that Benjamin Graham taught there. He earned a Master of Science in Economics from Columbia in 1951. After graduating, Buffett attended the New York Institute of Finance.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The basic ideas of investing are to look at stocks as business, use the market's fluctuations to your advantage, and seek a margin of safety. That's what Ben Graham taught us. A hundred years from now they will still be the cornerstones of investing.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite">
<h3><span id="Early_business_career" class="mw-headline">Early business career</span></h3>
<p>Buffett worked from 1951 to 1954 at Buffett-Falk &amp; Co. as an investment salesman; from 1954 to 1956 at Graham-Newman Corp. as a securities analyst; from 1956 to 1969 at Buffett Partnership, Ltd. as a general partner and from 1970, as Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</p>
<p>In April 1952, Buffett discovered that Graham was on the board of GEICO insurance. Taking a train to Washington, D.C. on a Saturday, he knocked on the door of GEICO's headquarters until a janitor admitted him. There he met Lorimer Davidson, Geico's Vice President, and the two discussed the insurance business for hours. Davidson would eventually become Buffett's lifelong friend and a lasting influence,&nbsp;and would later recall that he found Buffett to be an "extraordinary man" after only fifteen minutes. Buffett wanted to work on Wall Street; however, both his father and Ben Graham urged him not to. He offered to work for Graham for free, but Graham refused.</p>
<p>Buffett returned to Omaha and worked as a stockbroker while taking a Dale Carnegie public speaking course.&nbsp;Using what he learned, he felt confident enough to teach an "Investment Principles" night class at the University of Nebraska-Omaha. The average age of his students was more than twice his own. During this time he also purchased a Sinclair Texaco gas station as a side investment. However, this was not successful.</p>
<p>In 1952,&nbsp;Buffett married Susan Thompson at Dundee Presbyterian Church. The next year they had their first child, Susan Alice. In 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (about $107,000 today).&nbsp;There he worked closely with Walter Schloss. Graham was a tough boss. He was adamant that stocks provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. The argument made sense to Buffett but he questioned whether the criteria were too stringent and caused the company to miss out on big winners that had other appealing features.&nbsp;That same year the Buffetts had their second child, Howard Graham. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett's personal savings were over $174,000 (about $1.53 million today)and he started Buffett Partnership Ltd.</p>

<p>In 1957, Buffett operated three partnerships. He purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in Omaha, where he still lives, for $31,500.In 1958 the Buffetts' third child, Peter Andrew, was born. Buffett operated five partnerships that year. In 1959, the company grew to six partnerships and Buffett met future partner Charlie Munger. By 1960, Buffett operated seven partnerships. He asked one of his partners, a doctor, to find ten other doctors willing to invest $10,000 each in his partnership. Eventually eleven agreed, and Buffett pooled their money with a mere $100 original investment of his own. In 1961, Buffett revealed that Sanborn Map Company accounted for 35% of the partnership's assets. He explained that in 1958 Sanborn stock sold at only $45 per share when the value of the Sanborn investment portfolio was $65 per share. This meant that buyers valued Sanborn stock at "minus $20" per share and were unwilling to pay more than 70 cents on the dollar for an investment portfolio with a map business thrown in for nothing which earned him a spot on Sanborn's board.</p>
<h3><span id="Assuming_Berkshire" class="mw-headline">Assuming Berkshire</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>n 1962, Buffett became a millionaire because of his partnerships, which in January 1962 had an excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett. He merged these partnerships into one. Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing firm, Berkshire Hathaway. He began buying shares in Berkshire from Seabury Stanton, the owner, whom he later fired. Buffett's partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In 1965, when Buffett's partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while the company had working capital of $19 per share. This did not include the value of fixed assets (factory and equipment). Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway at a board meeting and named a new president, Ken Chace, to run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new money. He later claimed that the textile business had been his worst trade.&nbsp;He then moved the business into the insurance sector, and, in 1985, the last of the mills that had been the core business of Berkshire Hathaway was sold. Buffett wrote in his letter: "...&nbsp;unless it appears that circumstances have changed (under some conditions added capital would improve results) or unless new partners can bring some asset to the partnership other than simply capital, I intend to admit no additional partners to BPL."</p>
<p>In a second letter, Buffett announced his first investment in a private business&nbsp;&mdash; Hochschild, Kohn and Co, a privately owned Baltimore department store. In 1967, Berkshire paid out its first and only dividend of 10 cents. In 1969, following his most successful year, Buffett liquidated the partnership and transferred their assets to his partners. Among the assets paid out were shares of Berkshire Hathaway. In 1970, Buffett began writing his now-famous annual letters to shareholders. However, he lived solely on his salary of $50,000 per year and his outside investment income. In 1979, Berkshire began the year trading at $775 per share, and ended at $1,310. Buffett's net worth reached $620&nbsp;million.</p>
<p>In 1973, Berkshire began to acquire stock in the Washington Post Company. Buffett became close friends with Katharine Graham, who controlled the company and its flagship newspaper, and joined its board. In 1974, the SEC opened a formal investigation into Buffett and Berkshire's acquisition of Wesco Financial, due to possible conflict of interest. No charges were brought. In 1977, Berkshire indirectly purchased the <em>Buffalo Evening News</em> for $32.5&nbsp;million. Antitrust charges started, instigated by its rival, the <em>Buffalo Courier-Express</em>. Both papers lost money, until the <em>Courier-Express</em> folded in 1982.</p>
<p>In 1979, Berkshire began to acquire stock in ABC. Capital Cities announced a $3.5&nbsp;billion purchase of ABC on March 18, 1985 surprising the media industry, as ABC was four times bigger than Capital Cities at the time. Buffett helped finance the deal in return for a 25% stake in the combined company.&nbsp;The newly merged company, known as Capital Cities/ABC (or CapCities/ABC), was forced to sell some stations due to U.S. Federal Communications Commission ownership rules. The two companies also owned several radio stations in the same markets.</p>
<p>In 1987, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 12% stake in Salomon Inc., making it the largest shareholder and Buffett a director. In 1990, a scandal involving John Gutfreund (former CEO of Salomon Brothers) surfaced. A rogue trader, Paul Mozer, was submitting bids in excess of what was allowed by Treasury rules. When this was brought to Gutfreund's attention, he did not immediately suspend the rogue trader. Gutfreund left the company in August 1991.&nbsp;Buffett became Chairman of Salomon until the crisis passed.</p>
<p>In 1988, Buffett began buying The Coca-Cola Company stock, eventually purchasing up to 7% of the company for $1.02&nbsp;billion. It would turn out to be one of Berkshire's most lucrative investments, and one which it still holds.</p>
<h2><span id="Investment_philosophy" class="mw-headline">Investment philosophy</span></h2>
<p>Warren Buffett's writings include his annual reports and various articles. Buffett is recognized by communicators&nbsp;as a great story-teller, as evidenced by his annual letters to shareholders. He warned about the pernicious effects of inflation:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The arithmetic makes it plain that inflation is a far more devastating tax than anything that has been enacted by our legislatures. The inflation tax has a fantastic ability to simply consume capital. It makes no difference to a widow with her savings in a 5 percent passbook account whether she pays 100 percent income tax on her interest income during a period of zero inflation, or pays no income taxes during years of 5 percent inflation.</p>
<div class="templatequotecite">&nbsp;</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In his article "The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville", Buffett rebutted the academic efficient-market hypothesis, that beating the S&amp;P 500 was "pure chance", by highlighting the results achieved by a number of students of the Graham and Dodd value investing school of thought. In addition to himself, Buffett named Walter J. Schloss, Tom Knapp, Ed Anderson (Tweedy, Browne LLC), William J. Ruane (Sequoia Fund, Inc.), Charles Munger (Buffett's own business partner at Berkshire), Rick Guerin (Pacific Partners, Ltd.), and Stan Perlmeter (Perlmeter Investments).<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference">]</sup> In his November 1999 <em>Fortune</em> article, he warned of investors' unrealistic expectations:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>Let me summarize what I've been saying about the stock market: I think it's very hard to come up with a persuasive case that equities will over the next 17 years perform anything like&mdash;anything like&mdash;they've performed in the past 17. If I had to pick the most probable return, from appreciation and dividends combined, that investors in aggregate&mdash;repeat, aggregate&mdash;would earn in a world of constant interest rates, 2% inflation, and those ever hurtful frictional costs, it would be 6%!</p>

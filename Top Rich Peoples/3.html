<h2><span id="Criticism" class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>Bezos was named World's Worst Boss by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), at their World Congress, in May 2014. In making the award, Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the ITUC, said "Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the American corporate model..."&nbsp;An article in the <em>New York Times</em> described working for Bezos and Amazon in the offices as a grueling and inhumane experience with many employees regularly being terminated or quitting.</p>
<p>Under Bezos&rsquo;s direction, Amazon has been criticized as "stingy" in its corporate giving practices.</p>
<p>Journalist Shawn McCoy contrasted the philanthropic practices of Amazon and Bezos with the comparatively more generous Microsoft (also based near Seattle) and fellow billionaire Bill Gates.&nbsp;Some found Bezos more akin to Steve Jobs, who was skeptical of philanthropy and made few donations</p>

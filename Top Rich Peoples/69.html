As of 2015, she and her husband have pledged more than $1.6 billion to charities.

<h2><span id="Biography" class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Chan was born in Braintree, Massachusetts,&nbsp;and grew up in Quincy, Massachusetts, just outside of Boston. Her parents were ethnic Chinese refugees&nbsp;who fled Vietnam in refugee boats. She grew up speaking Cantonese and served as interpreter for her grandparents. She has two younger sisters.&nbsp;In 2003, she graduated as class valedictorian from Quincy High School, and was voted "class genius" by her classmates.&nbsp;According to a Facebook post by Mark Zuckerberg, Chan is a Buddhist.</p>
<p>Chan entered Harvard University in 2003, where she met and began dating Mark Zuckerberg. She graduated in 2007 with a BA in biology, and also studied Spanish. She is fluent in Cantonese, English and Spanish. She is the first person in her family to graduate from college.</p>
<p>After graduation, she taught science at the private Harker School for a year, before entering medical school at the University of California, San Francisco in 2008. She graduated in 2012, and finished her pediatric residency in the summer of 2015.&nbsp;She married Zuckerberg on May 19, 2012, a day after Facebook's stock market launch.</p>
<p>Chan and Zuckerberg announced the birth of their daughter, Maxima Chan Zuckerberg ("Max", Chinese: <span lang="zh-Hans" xml:lang="zh-Hans">陈明宇</span>; pinyin: <em><span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin" xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Ch&eacute;n M&iacute;ngyǔ</span></em>; Jyutping: <em><span lang="yue-jyutping" xml:lang="yue-jyutping">Can4 Ming4 Jyu5</span></em>, on December 1, 2015.</p>
<h2><span id="Philanthropy" class="mw-headline">Philanthropy</span></h2>
<p>Zuckerberg and Chan have pledged about $1.6 billion to charities,&nbsp;including a donation of $75 million to San Francisco General Hospital, where Chan worked.&nbsp;In 2013, they gave 18 million Facebook shares (valued at more than $970 million) to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. <em>The Chronicle of Philanthropy</em> placed the couple at the top of its list of 50 most generous American philanthropists for that year.&nbsp;They also pledged $120 million to public schools in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>On December 1, 2015, Chan and Zuckerberg posted an open Facebook letter to their newborn daughter. They pledged to donate 99% of their Facebook shares, then valued at $45 billion, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which is their new charitable foundation that focuses on health and education.</p>
<p>Chan's charitable goals focus on education, healthcare and science, which are closely tied to her personal background.&nbsp;She is considered to have had a strong influence on the philanthropy of her husband.&nbsp;She plans to launch The Primary School in 2016, a nonprofit organization that will provide K&ndash;12 education as well as prenatal care, in East Palo Alto, California.</p>

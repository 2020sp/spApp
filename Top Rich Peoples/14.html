<p><strong>Bernard Jean &Eacute;tienne Arnault</strong> (<small>French:&nbsp;</small><span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">bɛʁnaːʁ aʁno</span>&nbsp;born 5 March 1949) is a French business magnate, an investor, and an art collector.</p>
<p>Arnault is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of LVMH. He is the richest man in France, and the 13th richest person in the world. In November 2016, his wealth was estimated to be US$37.3 billion.</p>
<h2><span id="Early_life" class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>After graduating from the Maxence Van Der Meersch High School in Roubaix, Arnault was admitted to &Eacute;cole Polytechnique, from which he graduated with an Engineering degree in 1971.</p>
<p>His father, Jean Leon Arnault, a graduate of &Eacute;cole Centrale Paris, was a manufacturer and the owner of the civil engineering company, <em>Ferret-Savinel</em>.</p>
<h2><span id="Career" class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<h3><span id="F.C3.A9rinel" class="mw-headline">F&eacute;rinel</span></h3>
<p>After graduation, Arnault joined his father's company in 1971. In 1976, he convinced his father to liquidate the construction division of the company for 40 million French francs, and to change the focus of the company to real estate. Using the name F&eacute;rinel, the new company developed a specialty in holiday accommodation. Named Director of Company Development in 1974, he became the CEO in 1977. In 1979, he succeeded his father as President of the company.</p>
<h3><span id="Christian_Dior" class="mw-headline">Christian Dior</span></h3>
<p>In 1984, with the help of Antoine Bernheim, a Senior Partner of Lazard Fr&egrave;res et Cie., Arnault acquired the Financi&egrave;re Agache, a luxury goods company.&nbsp;He became the CEO of Financi&egrave;re Agache, and subsequently took control of Boussac, a textile company in turmoil. Boussac owned Christian Dior, the department store Le Bon March&eacute;, the retail shop Conforama and the diapers industrial Peaudouce. He sold nearly all the company's assets, keeping only the prestigious Christian Dior brand, and Le Bon March&eacute; department store.</p>
<h3><span id="LVMH" class="mw-headline">LVMH</span></h3>
<p>In 1987, shortly after the creation of LVMH, the new luxury group resulting from the merger between two companies, Arnault mediated a conflict between Alain Chevalier, Mo&euml;t Hennessy's CEO, and Henri Racamier, president of Louis Vuitton. The new group held property rights to Dior perfumes, which Arnault believed should be incorporated into Dior Couture.</p>
<p>In July 1988, Arnault provided $1.5 billion to form a holding company with Guinness that held 24% of LVMH's shares. In response to rumors that the Louis Vuitton group was buying LVMH's stock to form a "blocking minority", Arnault spent $600 million to buy 13.5% more of LVMH, making him LVMH's first shareholder. In January 1989, Bernard Arnault spent another $500 million to gain control a total of 43.5% of LVMH, and 35% of voting rights, thus reaching the "blocking minority" he needed to stop the dismantlement of the LVMH group. On 13 January 1989, he was unanimously elected chairman of the executive management board.</p>
<p>Since then, Arnault led the company through an ambitious development plan, transforming it into one of the largest luxury groups in the world, alongside Swiss luxury giant Richemont and French-based Kering. In eleven years, the market value of LVMH has multiplied by at least fifteen, while, simultaneously, the sales and profit rose by 500%. He promoted decisions towards decentralizing the group's brands. As a result of these measures, the brands are now viewed as independent firms with their own history.</p>
<p>Arnault professional decisions support the idea that LVMH has "shared advantages": the strongest brands help finance those that are still developing. The portfolio of major luxury brands has a history of stability, and thus its solidity allows for new acquisitions and group development. It is because of this strategy that Christian Lacroix could open his own fashion house.</p>
<p>In July 1988, Arnault acquired C&eacute;line.&nbsp;In 1993, LVMH acquired Berluti and Kenzo. In the same year, Arnault bought out the French economic newspaper <em>La Tribune</em>.&nbsp;The company never achieved the desired success, despite his 150 million euro investment, and he sold it in November 2007 in order to buy a different French economic newspaper <em>Les &Eacute;chos</em>, for 240 million Euros.</p>
<p>In 1994, LVMH acquired the perfume firm Guerlain.&nbsp;In 1996, Arnault bought out Loewe,&nbsp;followed by Marc Jacobs and Sephora in 1997.&nbsp;These brands were also integrated into the group: Thomas Pink in 1999, Emilio Pucci in 2000 and Fendi, DKNY and La Samaritaine in 2001.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Arnault decided to develop a centre in New York to manage LVMH's presence in the United States. He chose Christian de Portzamparc to supervise this project.The result was the LVMH Tower, which opened in December 1999.</p>
<h3><span id="Other_investments" class="mw-headline">Other investments</span></h3>
<p>From 1998 to 2001, Arnault invested in a variety of web companies: Boo.com, Libertysurf and Zebank through his holding Europatweb. Groupe Arnault also invested in Netflix in 1999.</p>
<p>In 2007, his company Blue Capital, that Arnault owns jointly with the California property firm Colony Capital, acquired 10.69% of France's largest supermarket retailer and the world's second-largest food distributor, Carrefour.</p>
<p>In 2008, he entered the yacht business and bought Princess Yachts for 253 million Euros.&nbsp;He subsequently took control of Royal van Lent for an almost identical sum.</p>
<h2><span id="Art_collector" class="mw-headline">Art collector</span></h2>
<p>Arnault is a noted art collector, and is known for his contemporary collection that includes pieces by Picasso, Yves Klein, Henry Moore and Andy Warhol. &nbsp;He was also instrumental in establishing LVMH as a major patron of Art in France.</p>
<p>The LVMH group created The "Young Fashion Designer" Prize. It is an international competition which is open to students from Fine arts schools. Every year, the winner is awarded with a grant to support the creation of his or her label and with a year of mentorship.</p>
<p>From 1999 to 2003, he owned Phillips de Pury &amp; Company, an art auction house, and bought out the first French auctioneer, Tajan.</p>
<p>In 2006, Arnault started the building project of the Louis Vuitton Foundation. Dedicated to creation and contemporary art, the building was designed by the architect Frank Gehry, who also designed the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.&nbsp;The Foundation's grand opening at the Jardin d'Acclimatation was held on 20 October 2014.</p>

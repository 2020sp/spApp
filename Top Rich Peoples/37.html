<p><strong>Evelyn Robert Adrian de Rothschild</strong> (born 29 August 1931)&nbsp;is a British billionaire financier, and a member of the Rothschild family.</p>
<h2><span id="Early_life" class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Son of Anthony Gustav de Rothschild (1887&ndash;1961) and Yvonne Lydia Louise Cahen d'Anvers (1899&ndash;1977), he was named after his uncle Evelyn Achille de Rothschild who was killed in action in World War I. Evelyn de Rothschild spent several of his boyhood years in the United States during World War II. He was a pupil at Harrow School&nbsp;and then studied history at Trinity College, University of Cambridge but he dropped out before obtaining a degree.</p>
<p>Born into great wealth, Evelyn de Rothschild became one of England's most eligible bachelors, spending his youth travelling, socialising, driving exotic sports cars, enjoying thoroughbred horse racing and playing polo. It was not until age 26 that he decided to join N M Rothschild &amp; Sons banking house to be trained in the family's business. In 1955, a couple years prior to Sir Evelyn's entry into the family's business, his father had to retire from the position of chairman due to illness and his cousin Victor Rothschild took over as chairman.</p>

In 2003, he founded with his wife, Lynn Forester de Rothschild, a holding company, E.L. Rothschild, to manage their investments in <em>The Economist</em> and various enterprises in India.</p>

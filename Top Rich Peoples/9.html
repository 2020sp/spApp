<p><strong>David Hamilton Koch</strong> (<span class="nowrap"><span class="IPA nopopups">/<span title="/ˈ/ primary stress follows">ˈ</span><span title="'k' in 'kind'">k</span><span title="/oʊ/ long 'o' in 'code'">oʊ</span><span title="'k' in 'kind'">k</span>/</span></span>; born May 3, 1940) is an American businessman, philanthropist, political activist, and chemical engineer. He joined the family business Koch Industries, a conglomerate that is the second-largest privately held company in the United States, in 1970. He became president of the subsidiary Koch Engineering in 1979, and became a co-owner of Koch Industries, with older brother Charles, in 1983. He is now an executive vice president.&nbsp;Koch is an influential libertarian. He was the 1980 candidate for Vice President of the United States from the United States Libertarian Party and helped finance the campaign. He founded Citizens for a Sound Economy.&nbsp;He and his brother Charles have donated to political advocacy groups&nbsp;and to political campaigns, almost entirely Republican.</p>
<p><em>Cond&eacute; Nast Portfolio</em> described him as "one of the most generous but low-key philanthropists in America".&nbsp;Koch has contributed to several charities including Lincoln Center, Sloan Kettering, New York-Presbyterian Hospital and the Dinosaur Wing at the American Museum of Natural History.&nbsp;The New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, home of the New York City Ballet was renamed the David H. Koch Theater in 2008 following a gift of 100 million dollars for the renovation of the theater. Koch is the fourth richest person in America as of 2012, and the wealthiest resident of New York City as of 2013.&nbsp;He is the ninth-wealthiest person in the world, as of 2014.&nbsp;He is a survivor of the USAir Flight 1493 crash in 1991.</p>
<h2><span id="Early_life_and_education" class="mw-headline">Early life and education</span></h2>
<p>Koch was born in Wichita, Kansas, the son of Mary Clementine (n&eacute;e Robinson) and Fred Chase Koch, a chemical engineer. David's paternal grandfather, Harry Koch, was a Dutch immigrant who founded the Quanah Tribune-Chief newspaper and was a founding shareholder of Quanah, Acme and Pacific Railway.&nbsp;David is the third of four sons, with elder brothers Frederick R. Koch, Charles Koch, and nineteen-minute younger twin&nbsp;Bill Koch. Among his maternal great-great-grandparents were William Ingraham Kip, an Episcopalian bishop, William Burnet Kinney, a politician, and Elizabeth Clementine Stedman, a writer.</p>
<p>Koch attended the Deerfield Academy prep school in Massachusetts, graduating in 1959. He went on to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), earning both a bachelor's (1962) and a master's degree (1963) in chemical engineering. He is a member of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity. Koch played basketball at MIT, averaging 21 points per game at MIT over three years, a school record. He also held the single-game scoring record of 41 points from 1962 until 2009, when it was eclipsed by Jimmy Bartolotta.</p>
<h2><span id="Career_at_Koch_Industries" class="mw-headline">Career at Koch Industries</span></h2>
<p>In 1970, Koch joined Koch Industries under his brother Charles, to work as a technical-services manager. He founded the company&rsquo;s New York office and in 1979 he became the president of his own division, Koch Engineering, renamed Chemical Technology Group. In 1985, Koch Industries was sued by Bill Koch and Frederick R. Koch for the first time in a long series of lawsuits about ownership, that lasted until 2001. As of 2010, David Koch owned 42 percent of Koch Industries, as does his brother Charles.</p>
<h2><span id="Political_career" class="mw-headline">Political career</span></h2>
<p>Koch was the Libertarian Party's vice-presidential candidate in the 1980 presidential election,&nbsp;sharing the party ticket with presidential candidate Ed Clark. The Clark&ndash;Koch ticket promised to abolish Social Security, the Federal Reserve Board, welfare, minimum-wage laws, corporate taxes, all price supports and subsidies for agriculture and business, and U.S. Federal agencies including the SEC, EPA, ICC, FTC, OSHA, FBI, CIA, and DOE.&nbsp;The ticket received 921,128 votes, 1% of the total nationwide vote,the Libertarian Party national ticket's best showing as of 2015 in terms of percentage and its best showing in terms of raw votes until the 2012 presidential election&ldquo;Compared to what the Libertarians had] gotten before,&rdquo; Charles said, &ldquo;and where we were as a movement or as a political/ideological point of view, that was pretty remarkable, to get 1 percent of the vote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the bid, according to journalist Brian Doherty's <em>Radicals for Capitalism</em>, Koch viewed politicians as "actors playing out a script".</p>
<p>Koch credits the campaign of Roger MacBride as his inspiration for getting involved in politics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here was a great guy, advocating all the things I believed in. He wanted less government and taxes, and was talking about repealing all these victimless crime laws that accumulated on the books. I have friends who smoke pot. I know many homosexuals. It's ridiculous to treat them as criminals&mdash;and here was someone running for president, saying just that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Koch gave his own Vice Presidential campaign $100,000 a month after being chosen as Ed Clark's running mate. "We'd like to abolish the Federal Elections Commission and all the limits on campaign spending anyway," Koch said in 1980. When asked why he ran, he replied: "Lord knows I didn't need a job, but I believe in what the Libertarians are saying. I suppose if they hadn't come along, I could have been a big Republican from Wichita. But hell&mdash;<em>everybody</em> from Kansas is a Republican."</p>
<p>In 1984 he broke with the Libertarian Party when it supported eliminating all taxes. Since then, Koch has been a Republican.</p>
<h3><span id="Arts" class="mw-headline">Arts</span></h3>
<p>In July 2008, Koch pledged $100 million over 10 years to renovate the New York State Theater in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, now named in his honor &nbsp;and pledged $10 million to renovate fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
<p>Koch has been a trustee of the American Ballet Theatre for 25 years&nbsp;and has contributed more than $6 million to the theater&nbsp;He also sits on the Board of Trustees of WGBH-TV,<sup class="noprint Inline-Template noprint Template-Fact"><em><span title="secondary source needed for noteworthiness (July 2015)">non-primary </span></em></sup>&nbsp;which produces more than two-thirds of the nationally distributed programs broadcast by PBS.</p>
<h3><span id="Education" class="mw-headline">Education</span></h3>
<p>From 1982 to 2013, Koch contributed $18.6 million to WGBH Educational Foundation, including $10 million to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) show <em>Nova</em>.&nbsp;Koch is a contributor to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., including a $20 million gift to the American Museum of Natural History, creating the David H. Koch Dinosaur Wing and a contribution of $15 million to the National Museum of Natural History to create the new <em>David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins</em>, which opened on the museum's 100th anniversary of its location on the National Mall on March 17, 2010.&nbsp;He also serves on the executive board of the Institute of Human Origins.In 2012, Koch contributed US $35 million to the Smithsonian to build a new dinosaur exhibition hall at the National Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>Koch also financed the construction of the $68 million Koch Center for mathematics, science and technology at the Deerfield Academy, a highly selective independent, coeducational boarding school at Deerfield, Massachusetts,&nbsp;and was named its first and only Lifetime Trustee.</p>
<p>Koch gave $10 million to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory &nbsp;where he was honored with the Double Helix Medal for Corporate Leadership for supporting research that, "improves the health of people everywhere".</p>
<h3><span id="Prison_reform" class="mw-headline">Prison reform</span></h3>
<p>In July 2015 David Koch and his brother were commended by both President Obama and activist Anthony Van Jones for their bipartisan efforts to reform the prison system in the United States.&nbsp;For nearly ten years the Kochs have been advocating for several reforms within the criminal justice system which include, reducing recidivism rates, simplifying the employment process for the rehabilitated, and defending private property from government seizures through Asset forfeiture.&nbsp;Allying with groups such as the ACLU, the Center for American Progress, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the Coalition for Public Safety, and the MacArthur Foundation, the Kochs maintain the current prison system unfairly targets low-income and minority communities at the expense of the public budget.</p>
<h2><span id="Criticism" class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>In August 2010, Jane Mayer wrote an article in <em>The New Yorker</em> on the political spending of David and Charles Koch stating: "As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics in America."&nbsp;Mayer's article was criticized by conservatives for not enumerating the Kochs' charitable donations.&nbsp;Mayer's article was also criticized by Koch Industries as using "psycho-biographic innuendo, unnamed sources, and half-truths".</p>
<p>An opinion piece by journalist Yasha Levine in the <em>New York Observer</em> said Mayer's article failed to mention that the Kochs' "free market philanthropy belies the immense profit they have made from corporate welfare".</p>
<p>Kimberly O. Dennis, president and chief executive officer of the Searle Freedom Trust,&nbsp;said in 2010 that the Kochs are acting against their economic interest in promoting "getting government out of the business of running the economy. If they were truly interested in protecting their profits, they wouldn&rsquo;t be spending so much to shrink government; they&rsquo;d be looking for a bigger slice of the pie for themselves. Their funding is devoted to promoting free-market capitalism, not crony capitalism."</p>
<h2><span id="Recognition" class="mw-headline">Recognition</span></h2>
<p><em>Time</em> included Charles and David Koch among the Time 100 of 2011, for their involvement in supporting the Tea Party movement and the criticism they received from liberals.</p>

<h2><span id="Investment_fund_PPF" class="mw-headline">Investment fund PPF</span></h2>
<p>In 1991, after the announcement of Czechoslovak voucher privatization, he founded the investment fund PPF (Prvn&iacute; privatizačn&iacute; fond) &nbsp;with Milan Vinkler and state-owned glassworks Sklo Union. In 1992, PPF investičn&iacute; společnost a.s. was established and the funds&rsquo; names were changed from privatisation to investment. The funds were very successful and purchased stock of more than 200 corporations with nominal value 5&nbsp;billion CZK.</p>
<h2><span id=".C4.8Cesk.C3.A1_poji.C5.A1.C5.A5ovna" class="mw-headline">Česk&aacute; poji&scaron;ťovna</span></h2>
<p>In 1995 and 1996, PPF bought a 20% stake in the largest Czech insurance company, Česk&aacute; poji&scaron;ťovna and started to manage it. Later PPF acquired more shares and became the dominant (93%) owner in 2001, when PPF bought large stakes of shares from Komerčn&iacute; banka and the Czech state.&nbsp;With help of these profitable transactions, the last investors from voucher privatization were bought out and Petr Kellner became the dominant owner of PPF group.</p>
<h2><span id="Assicurazioni_Generali" class="mw-headline">Assicurazioni Generali</span></h2>
<p>In 2007, PPF group signed a contract with Assicurazioni Generali to create a joint venture between PPF Group&rsquo;s insurance branch and Assicurazioni Generali's corporations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. According to sources PPF Group will own 49% of that company from the start, and Generali will pay &euro;1.1&nbsp;billion to the PPF Group for its stake. Petr Kellner became member of the Board of Directors of Generali.Kellner himself later bought 2.02% stake in Assicurazioni Generali.</p>
<p>In 2013 Kellner's PPF sold their remaining shares in the Generali PPF Holding (GPH) to Generali for &euro;2.5 billion, who became sole owner effective at year end of 2014.&nbsp;As of 2015 Kellner is no longer a member of the Generali Board.</p>
<h2><span id="Wealth" class="mw-headline">Wealth</span></h2>
<p>As of 2013, Kellner owned 98.94% of the PPF financial group.&nbsp;In 2006, <em>Forbes</em> estimated PPF's net worth at US $3&nbsp;billion and listed Kellner as 224th wealthiest man in the world. In 2007, he moved up to 119th with US$6&nbsp;billion and then in 2008 to 91st with US$9.3&nbsp;billion. In 2009 he was 76th with US$6&nbsp;billion&nbsp;and in 2010 89th with US$7.6&nbsp;billion.&nbsp;Kellner's newest position on the <em>Forbes</em> list is 137th with an estimated wealth of US$9.2&nbsp;billion (2015).</p>
<p>However, the above figures were criticized as overestimated by some Czech economic media. Their estimates were considerably lower, CZK 60&ndash;75&nbsp;billion (approx. US$4&nbsp;billion) according to the weekly <em>T&yacute;den</em>,&nbsp;or even less than CZK 50&nbsp;billion (app. US$3&nbsp;billion) according to journalist Miroslav Motejlek.&nbsp;Thus, Kellner would have been surpassed by entrepreneur Andrej Babi&scaron; on the position of the wealthiest resident of the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Formerly, he owned a Gulfstream G500 airplane named <em>K&aacute;ně</em>.&nbsp;In 2010 he bought a Boeing 737-700BBJ as his business airplane.&nbsp;He lives in an extensive residence in the village of Podkoz&iacute; near Prague, but he owns a number of other real estates in various countries. He also owns one of the largest collections of photographs taken by Josef Sudek</p>

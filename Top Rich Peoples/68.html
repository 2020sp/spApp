<p><strong>Vladimir Olegovich Potanin</strong> (<em>Владимир Олегович Потанин</em> in Russian; born 3 January 1961) is a Russian billionaire and entrepreneur. He acquired his wealth notably through the controversial loans-for-shares program in Russia.&nbsp;He is one of the wealthiest men in Russia, with an estimated net worth of $13.5 billion (Forbes 2016). His long-term business partner was Mikhail Prokhorov until they decided to split in 2008. Subsequently, they put their mutual assets in a holding company, Folletina Trading, until their asset division was agreed upon.</p>

<p>Potanin was born in Moscow, in the former USSR, into a high-ranking communist family.&nbsp;In 1978, he attended the faculty of the International economic relations at Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO), which groomed students for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Upon graduating MGIMO in 1983, he followed in his father's footsteps and went to work for the FTO "Soyuzpromexport" with the Ministry of Foreign trade of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h2><span id="Career" class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<p>During perestroika, Vladimir Potanin quit the State&rsquo;s structures of Foreign trade and in 1991 created the private association Interros using his knowledge gathered at Ministry of Foreign trade and his previous professional network.

<p>Potanin's Interros owns 30% and controls Russian Nickel giant Norilsk Nickel, a company owned by Oleg Deripaska's RUSAL, Abram Reznikov's Alamak Espana Trade and Alisher Usmanov's Metalloinvest. Since March 2003 Potanin has taken charge of the National Council on Corporate Governance (NSKU), whose main goal is to improve the legislative regulations in Russia and to introduce professional and ethical standards of corporate governance into the operations of Russian companies to boost up the reputation and investment appeal of the Russian business.</p>
<p>Since December 2001 he has been a member of the Board of Trustees of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation (NYC). In April 2003 Potanin was elected Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the State Hermitage, the most renowned Russian art museum. Since 2005 Potanin has been a member of the Public Chamber of Russia.

In March 2009, he sued former business partner Mikhail Prokhorov for $29 million over a property disagreement in Moscow.</p>

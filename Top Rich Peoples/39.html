<p><strong>Hassanal Bolkiah</strong>, GCB GCMG (full name: Sultan <strong>Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah</strong> ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar Ali Saifuddien Sa'adul Khairi Waddien; born 15 July 1946) is the 29th and current Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei. He is also the first and incumbent Prime Minister of Brunei. The eldest son of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III and <em>Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak</em> (Queen) Damit, he succeeded to the throne as the Sultan of Brunei, following the abdication of his father on 4 October 1967.</p>
<p>The Sultan has been ranked among the wealthiest individuals in the world; <em>Forbes</em> estimated the Sultan's total peak net worth at US$20 billion in 2008.</p>
<h2><span id="Early_years_and_education" class="mw-headline">Early years and education</span></h2>
<p>The Sultan was born on 15 July 1946 in Brunei Town (now called Bandar Seri Begawan) as <em>Pengiran Muda</em> (Crown Prince) Hassanal Bolkiah. The Sultan received high school education at Victoria Institution in Kuala Lumpur, after which he attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the United Kingdom, graduating in 1967.</p>
<h2><span id="Ascension_to_the_throne" class="mw-headline">Ascension to the throne</span></h2>
<p>He became the Sultan of Brunei Darussalam on 5 October 1967, after his father abdicated. His coronation was held on 1 August 1968, and made him the <em>Yang di-Pertuan</em> (Head of State) of Brunei. Like his father, he has been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, of which Brunei was a protectorate until 1984.</p>

</div>
<p>Under Brunei's 1959 constitution, the Sultan is the head of state with full executive authority, including emergency powers since 1962. On 9 March 2006, the Sultan was reported to have amended Brunei's constitution to make himself infallible under Bruneian law.&nbsp;Bolkiah, as Prime Minister, is also the head of government. In addition, he holds the portfolios both of Minister of Defense and Minister of Finance. As Minister of Defense he is therefore the Supreme Commander of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces, as well as an Honorary General in the British and Indonesian armed forces and an Honorary Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy. He appointed himself as Inspector General of Police (IGP) of the Royal Brunei Police Force.</p>
<p>Bolkiah addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Brunei Darussalam's admission to the United Nations in September 1984. In 1991, he introduced a conservative ideology to Brunei called Melayu Islam Beraja (<em>Malay Islamic Monarchy</em>, MIB), which presents the monarchy as the defender of the faith.&nbsp;He has recently favoured Brunei government democratisation and declared himself Prime Minister and President. In 2004, the Legislative Council, which had been dissolved since 1962, was reopened.</p>
<p>His designated successor is his eldest son, Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah.</p>
<p>The Sultan's official residence is the Istana Nurul Iman, with 1,788 rooms, 257 bathrooms, and a floor area of 2,152,782 square feet (200,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>; 20&nbsp;ha). The Istana also houses several offices of government, including that of the Office of the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan, the Office of the Grand Chamberlain, as well as the offices within the Prime Minister's Department. Parts of the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Finance are also located at the palace. The Crown Prince, who is the Senior Minister, works from offices at the Istana. Hyatt Borneo Management Services and HM The Sultan's flight maintain offices there.</p>

<p>The Sultan married his first cousin and first wife, Pengiran Anak Saleha or Princess Saleha, later became the <em>Raja Isteri</em> or Queen. His former second wife, Aisha Mariam (the former <em>Pengiran Isteri</em>), was a former flight attendant for the national carrier, Royal Brunei Airlines. He divorced her in 2003, stripping her of all her royal titles. In August 2005, her place was taken by a former Malaysian TV3 presenter, Azrinaz Mazhar Hakim, who is 33 years younger than the Sultan. They divorced in 2010, and as with Aisha Mariam, the Sultan stripped her of all titles, honours, and monthly allowance. The divorce was announced on Radio Television Brunei by the Grand Chamberlain.</p>
<p>Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah is the current <em>Pengiran Muda Mahkota</em> ("Crown Prince") and the Sultan's heir, as the eldest son of the Sultan and <em>Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak</em> Saleha. As of 2012, Hassanal Bolkiah has five sons and seven daughters with his three wives.</p>

<h3><span id="Other_honours" class="mw-headline">Other honours</span></h3>
<p>In January 2013, the Royal College of General Practitioners inaugurated the Sultan as the first Companion of the College for services to healthcare in Brunei and abroad.</p>
<h2><span id="Controversies" class="mw-headline">Controversies</span></h2>
<h3><span id="AMADEO_crisis" class="mw-headline">AMADEO crisis</span></h3>
<p>He had open disagreements with his brother, Jefri Bolkiah, who owned a network of companies and investment vehicles under the name "Amadeo" run by his son, Prince Hakim, which was used to buy the luxury goods company Asprey and build an amusement park and other projects in Brunei.&nbsp;In July 1998 the Amadeo group collapsed under US$10 billion in debt.&nbsp;Between 1983 and mid-1998 some US$40 billion of what were called "special transfers" were made from the accounts of the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA).An independent investigation was undertaken into the circumstances of these special transfers, concluding that in round figures, US$14.8 billion were paid to the accounts of Prince Jefri apart from the US$8 billion to accounts of the Sultan and US$3.8 billion for Government purposes. The destination, purpose and recipients of the remaining transfers were not established.&nbsp;Due to the secretive nature of the state and the blurred lines as to where the royal family's finances and the state finances began and ended, establishing the true course of events is very difficult.</p>
<p>Prince Jefri was accused of misappropriating state funds to pay for his own personal investments, bought through BIA and Amadeo companies and removed from his position as head of BIA.&nbsp;In February 2000 the Bruneian government attempted to obtain a freezing order on Prince Jefri's overseas assets, which led to him countersuing in New York.&nbsp;Following protracted negotiations a settlement agreement was signed by the Prince in May 2000,&nbsp;the terms of which were never made public.&nbsp;However, Prince Jefri claimed assurances were made to him by the Sultan with regards to keeping certain properties to maintain his lifestyle, which BIA denied.&nbsp;In accordance with the settlement agreement signed in 2000, the prince began to return his assets to the state, including more than 500 properties, both in Brunei and abroad, about 2500 cars, 100 paintings, five boats, and nine aircraft.&nbsp;In 2001 ten thousand lots of Prince Jefri's possessions went to auction.</p>
<p>However, the BIA alleged that the Prince failed to uphold the agreement by failing to disclose all his accounts, and allowing money to be taken from frozen accounts,&nbsp;and restarted legal proceedings to gain full control of the Prince's assets. After a number of appeals,&nbsp;this finally reached the Privy Council in London, which can serve as Brunei's highest court of appeal as a result of Brunei's former protectorate status.&nbsp;The Privy Council rejected Prince Jefri's evidence, describing his contention that the agreement allowed for him to retain a number of properties as "simply incredible",&nbsp;and ruled in favour of the Government of Brunei and the BIA; consequently the Prince's appeal was dismissed and he was ordered to return the rest of his assets to Brunei.&nbsp;The decision of the Privy Council did not end the litigation between Prince Jefri and the BIA. The BIA re-opened proceedings in Malaysia and the Cayman Islands, resulting in the BIA gaining control over the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles and The New York Palace Hotel in Manhattan.</p>
<p>The BIA also re-opened collateral litigation in the High Court of England and Wales. After winning before the Privy Council, the BIA asked the court to determine whether Prince Jefri should be held in contempt of court for allegedly making misstatements in his listing of assets. The contempt proceeding was scheduled for a hearing in June 2008, but the Prince did not attend, instead going to Paris.&nbsp;Judge Peter Smith did not rule on whether Prince Jefri was in contempt, but did issue a warrant for his arrest.&nbsp;As of November 2010, the warrant still appears to be in place, meaning the Prince will be arrested if he enters the UK.</p>
<p>As of October 2009, Prince Jefri appears to have been allowed back to Brunei. He is not back in any official government role but retains all his royal titles and decorations and remains in the royal protocol order. He is seen at major national functions like the national teachers day celebrations, the Sultan's birthday and at the National Day Celebrations. His most recent appearance was at The Legco (Legislative Council) opening ceremony in March 2012.</p>
<h2><span id="Interests" class="mw-headline">Interests</span></h2>
<p>The Sultan is passionate about cars. The royal family always maintains a collection of over 100 cars and the palace has the underground garage to accommodate them. Apart from this he once owned one of the largest private car collections in the world with about 2500 cars which his brother Jefri Bolkiah bought for himself, the Sultan and other members of the royal family to entertain their car passion. The car collection and Prince Jefri's other indulgences blew through billions and ultimately landed him in trouble and the royal family in financial crisis resulting the car collection to be left abandoned and most of the non garaged cars were beyond saving and rest were auctioned.</p>
<p>The Sultan's involvement in sports includes playing polo, golf, and badminton. He also enjoys race car driving, piloting helicopters, and aircraft. On international trips, he pilots his own Boeing 747-400.&nbsp;He is also very fond of gold and has a Rolls-Royce coated with 24k gold.</p>
<p>He often enjoys fine cigars, and has a notable favourite, the Gurkha Centurian, that was commissioned specifically for him.</p>
<p>His primary residence, the 1,800-room palace Istana Nurul Iman, is considered the world's largest private residence.</p>

He is informally known as the Czar of the Indian IT Industry.&nbsp;He was responsible for guiding Wipro through four decades of diversification and growth to finally emerge as one of the global leaders in the software industry.&nbsp;In 2010, he was voted among the 20 most powerful men in the world by Asiaweek. He has twice been listed among the 100 most influential people by TIME Magazine, once in 2004 and more recently in 2011.&nbsp;Premji owns 73% percent of Wipro and also owns a private equity fund, PremjiInvest, which manages his $2 billion worth of personal portfolio.

<h2><span id="Career" class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<p>In 1945, Muhammed Hashim Premji incorporated Western Indian Vegetable Products Ltd, based at Amalner, a small town in the Jalgaon district of Maharashtra.

The company, which was called Western Indian Vegetable Products at the time, dealt in hydrogenated oil manufacturing but Azim Premji later diversified the company to bakery fats, ethnic ingredient based toiletries, hair care soaps, baby toiletries, lighting products, and hydraulic cylinders. In the 1980s, the young entrepreneur, recognising the importance of the emerging IT field, took advantage of the vacuum left behind by the expulsion of IBM from India, changed the company name to <em>Wipro</em> and entered the high-technology sector by manufacturing minicomputers under technological collaboration with an American company Sentinel&nbsp;Computer Corporation.&nbsp;Thereafter Premji made a focused shift from soaps to software.</p>
<h2><span id="Personal_life" class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>Premji was born in Bombay,&nbsp;India in a Nizari Ismaili Shia Muslim&nbsp;family with origins from Kutch in Gujarat.&nbsp;His father was a noted businessman and was known as <em>Rice King of Burma</em>. After partition, when Jinnah invited his father Muhammed Hashem Premji to come to Pakistan, he turned down the request and chose to remain in India.</p>
<p>Premji has a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering degree (equivalent to a Bachelor of Engineering degree) from Stanford University, USA. He is married to Yasmeen. The couple have two children, Rishad and Tariq. Rishad is currently the Chief Strategy Officer of IT Business, Wipro.</p>
<h3><span id="Recognition" class="mw-headline">Recognition</span></h3>
<p>Premji has been recognised by Business Week as one of the <em>Greatest Entrepreneurs</em>&nbsp;for being responsible for Wipro emerging as one of the world's fastest growing companies.</p>

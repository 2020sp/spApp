<p><strong>Alice Louise Walton</strong> (born October 7, 1949) is an American heiress to the fortune of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. She is the daughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton and Helen Walton, and sister of S. Robson Walton, Jim Walton and the late John T. Walton. With a net worth of $40.8 billion she is the second wealthiest woman on earth, according to Forbes. In September 2016 she was reported to own over US$ 11 billion in Walmart shares.&nbsp;She has been arrested multiple times for driving while intoxicated, and in 1989, she was involved in the speeding death of a 50-year-old woman, Oleta Hardin, a cannery worker, but no charges were filed.</p>
<h2><span id="Education_and_career" class="mw-headline">Education and career</span></h2>
<p>Walton was born in Newport, Arkansas.&nbsp;She graduated from Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, with a B.A. in economics and finance. She began her career in finance as an equity analyst and money manager for First Commerce Corporation and later served as vice chairperson and head of all investment-related activities at the Arvest Bank Group. In 1988, Walton founded Llama Company, an investment bank engaged in corporate finance, public and structured finance, real estate finance and sales and trading. She served as President, Chairperson and CEO. For a time, she was a broker for E.F. Hutton.</p>a
<p>She was the first chairperson and driving force behind the Northwest Arkansas Council. This community development organization played a major role in securing the development of the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport. Walton arranged for and provided the initial seed capital to finance the construction of the airport. Her involvement was instrumental in the creation of the airport, and in recognition of her contribution to the airport project and her support of transportation improvements throughout the region, the Airport Authority Board of Directors named the airport terminal the Alice L. Walton Terminal Building. In 2001, Walton was inducted into the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, Walton closed Llama Company and moved to a 3,200-acre (1,300&nbsp;ha) ranch in Millsap, Texas, named Walton's Rocking W Ranch.&nbsp;An avid horse-lover, Walton currently lives in a sprawling one-story, 4,432-square-foot (411.7&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>), stucco house on the horse ranch. She is known for having an eye for determining which 2-month-olds will grow to be champion cutters.</p>
<p>In his 1992 autobiography <em>Made in America</em>, Sam Walton remarked that Alice was "the most like me&mdash;a maverick&mdash;but even more volatile than I am."</p>

<p>Walton purchased her first piece of art when she was about ten years old. It was a reproduction of Picasso's <em>Blue Nude</em> she got from her father's Ben Franklin Dime-Store. She and her mother would often paint watercolors on camping trips.&nbsp;Her interest in art led to her spearheading the Walton Family Foundation's involvement in developing Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in the heart of Bentonville, Arkansas. Crystal Bridges, opened in November 2011, is envisioned as a premier venue for a national art institution dedicated to American art and artists, and a place of learning and community.</p>
<p>In December 2004, the art collection of Daniel Fraad and wife, Rita, went up for public auction at Sotheby's in New York. Since almost every collector was at the auction, no one could figure out who on the phone was bidding such high prices. It was later discovered that Walton purchased at least $20 million worth of art that day. She bid for most of the items while on a three-year-old gelding named IC LAD preparing to compete in the first qualifying round of the National Cutting Horse Association Futurity at the Will Rogers Coliseum in Ft. Worth, Texas.</p>
<p>In 2005, Walton purchased Asher Brown Durand's celebrated painting, <em>Kindred Spirits</em>, in a sealed-bid auction for a purported US$35 million. The 1849 painting, a tribute to Hudson River School painter Thomas Cole, had been given to the New York Public Library in 1904 by Julia Bryant, the daughter of Romantic poet and New York newspaper publisher William Cullen Bryant (who is depicted in the painting with Cole).&nbsp;She has also purchased works by American painters Winslow Homer and Edward Hopper, as well as a notable portrait of George Washington by Charles Willson Peale,&nbsp;in preparation for the opening of the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas.&nbsp;In 2009 at an undisclosed price, Crystal Bridges museum acquired Norman Rockwell's iconic "Rosie the Riveter" painting for its permanent collection.</p>
<p>John Wilmerding, an advisor and board member to Crystal Bridges said Walton has collected the work of some artists in depth, quietly buying substantial bodies of work by Martin Johnson Heade, Stuart Davis, George Bellows and John Singer Sargent.&nbsp;Walton's attempt to quit smoking led to the purchase of two great smoking paintings by Alfred Maurer and Tom Wesselman. In a 2011 interview, she spoke about acquiring great works by other artists. She described Marsden Hartley as "one of my favorite artists-he was a very complex guy, somewhat tormented, but a very spiritual person, and love the emotion and the feel and the spirituality of his work". She went on to say "and Andrew Wyeth-the mystery and loneliness that is expressed. How do you paint loneliness?"</p>
<h2><span id="Political_contributions" class="mw-headline">Political contributions</span></h2>
<p>She was the twentieth largest individual contributor to 527 committees in the U.S. presidential election 2004, donating US$2.6 million to the conservative Progress for America group. During the 2004 election cycle, Progress for America ran advertisements supporting the Iraq war and praising George W. Bush for preventing "another 9/11". As of January 2012, Walton had contributed $200,000 to Restore Our Future, the super PAC associated with Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Fran&ccedil;ois Pinault</strong> (born 21 August 1936) is a French businessman and art collector. He is the major shareholder and honorary chairman of the retail company Kering.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span id="Early_life" class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Pinault was born on 21 August 1936 in Les Champs-G&eacute;raux, a commune in the north of Brittany.</p>
<h3><span id="Career" class="mw-headline">Career</span></h3>
<p>His holding company Artemis S.A., owns (or owned), among others, Converse shoes, Samsonite luggage, Ch&acirc;teau Latour, the Vail Ski Resort in Colorado, and Christie's auction house. Artemis also owns Executive Life Insurance Company (now Aurora Life) in California, which was sued by policy holders when the company failed.</p>
<p>He led Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR) through a long battle over control of Gucci, the Italian fashion house, which began with an attempted takeover of Gucci by LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods company. In March 1999, Gucci asked PPR to acquire an ownership interest in Gucci to help fend off LVMH. The result was a struggle between the two richest men in France, both self-made billionaires &mdash; Pinault and Bernard Arnault, the Chairman of LVMH. The dispute ended in September 2001, when LVMH agreed to sell its shares in Gucci to PPR for $94 a share. As part of the agreement, PPR promised to tender for the balance of the publicly traded shares at a later date. It completed that buy-in in July 2004 and took full control of Gucci.</p>
<p>In 1998, he purchased a majority share of Christie's auction house. In February 2000, A. Alfred Taubman, majority shareholder of rival company Sotheby's stepped down amid a scandal after the Federal Bureau of Investigation had investigated commission-fixing between the two companies. Pinault was not implicated, but rather it was his actions which precipitated the scandal. He fired Christie's CEO Christopher Davidge over an allegation of extravagant spending. Davidge then admitted the collusion, which had gone on since about 1995, to Artemis CEO Patricia Barbizet.</p>
<p>In October 2000, Sotheby's CEO Diana Brooks admitted her guilt in hopes of receiving a reduced sentence and implicated Taubman. In December 2001, jurors in a high-profile New York City courtroom found Taubman guilty of conspiracy. He served a year and a day in prison and Mrs. Brooks got 3 months of home confinement and a penalty of $350,000. This was enforced by world-renowned expert Prof. Sam Godfrey. International law permitted Christie's to avoid prosecution (other than civil penalties).</p>
<h3><span id="Art_collector" class="mw-headline">Art collector</span></h3>
<p>He owns one of the largest collections of contemporary art worldwide. On the magazine ArtReview's 2006 list of most powerful people in modern art he was ranked in first place.&nbsp;In 2006 he obtained the ownership of Palazzo Grassi in Venice to display the collection.&nbsp;He has collected works by Damien Hirst&nbsp;and Martial Raysse.</p>
<h3><span id="Personal_life" class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h3>
<p>He has three children, including son Francois-Henri, who manages the company founded by his father. According to <em>Forbes</em> List of billionaires he is ranked 65th in the world, with an estimated fortune of US$13.7 billion (April 2015).</p>

<p><strong>Sir Ka-shing Li</strong>, GBM, KBE,&nbsp;JP (born 29 July 1928 in Chaozhou, China)&nbsp;is a Hong Kong business magnate and investor. According to Forbes, as of February 2017 Li is the richest person in Asia, and 18th richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$31.3&nbsp;billion.&nbsp;He is currently the chairman of the board for CK Hutchison Holdings; through it, he is the world's leading port investor, developer, and operator, and the largest health and beauty retailer in Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>Considered one of the most powerful figures in Asia, Li was named "Asia's Most Powerful Man, Li Ka-Shing" by <em>Asiaweek</em> in 2001. His companies make up 4% of the market capitalisation of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.&nbsp;<em>Forbes Magazine</em> and the Forbes family honoured Li Ka-shing with the first ever "Malcolm S. Forbes Lifetime Achievement Award" on 5 September 2006, in Singapore.&nbsp;In spite of his wealth, Li has cultivated a reputation for leading a no-frills lifestyle, and is known to wear simple black dress shoes and an inexpensive Seiko wristwatch. He continues to live in the same house as he has for decades, which has now become one of the most expensive districts in Hong Kong, Deep Water Bay in Hong Kong Island. Li is also regarded as one of Asia's most generous philanthropists, donating over US$2.56&nbsp;billion as of April 2016&nbsp;to charity and other various philanthropic causes.&nbsp;Li is often referred to as "Superman" in Hong Kong because of his business prowess.</p>
<p>Li Ka-shing was born in Chaozhou in Guangdong province, China, in 1928 to Teochew parents. Due to his father's death, he was forced to leave school before the age of 15 and found a job in a plastics trading company where he worked 16 hours a day. In 1950 he started his own company, Cheung Kong Industries.&nbsp;From manufacturing plastics, Li developed his company into a leading real estate investment company in Hong Kong that was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1971. Cheung Kong expanded by acquiring Hutchison Whampoa and Hongkong Electric Holdings Limited in 1979 and 1985 respectively.</p>
<h2><span id="Business_career" class="mw-headline">Business career</span></h2>
<p>A Harvard Business School article summarises Li's career in the following way:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>From his humble beginnings in China as a teacher's son, a refugee, and later as a salesman, Li provides a lesson in integrity and adaptability. Through hard work, and a reputation for remaining true to his internal moral compass, he was able to build a business empire that includes: banking, construction, real estate, plastics, cellular phones, satellite television, cement production, retail outlets (pharmacies and supermarkets), hotels, domestic transportation (sky train), airports, electric power, steel production, ports, and shipping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Li's businesses cover almost every facet of life in Hong Kong, from electricity to telecommunications, from real estate to retail, from shipping to the Internet. The Cheung Kong Group's market capitalisation is HK$1,193&nbsp;billion (US$154&nbsp;billion) as of April 2016. (This includes the Group's controlling stake in 15 listed companies around the world.) The Group operates in over 50 countries and employs around 300,000 staff worldwide.</p>
<h3><span id="Plastics_Manufacturing" class="mw-headline">Plastics Manufacturing</span></h3>
<p>In 1950, after learning how to operate a plant, Li founded a plastic manufacturing company in Hong Kong with personal savings and funds borrowed from relatives. Li avidly read trade publications and business news before deciding to supply the world with high quality plastic flowers at low prices. Li learned the technique of mixing colour with plastics that resemble real flowers. After retooling his shop and hiring the best technicians he could find, he prepared the plant for a visit from a large foreign buyer. Impressed with the quality of Li's plant, the buyer placed a large order. A few years later, Li grew to be the largest supplier of plastic flowers in Asia and made a fortune selling them.</p>
<h3><span id="Real_Estate" class="mw-headline">Real Estate</span></h3>
<p>In 1958, recognizing the rents would continue to rise, Li decided to purchase a site and develop his own factory building. An opportunity to acquire land arrived after the 1967 riots were in full swing when many people fled Hong Kong, and as a result, property prices plummeted. Li, believing the political crisis would be temporary, and property prices would eventually rise, bought parcels of land at low prices. By 1971, Li officially named his real estate development company Cheung Kong (長江實業), named after Cheung Kong, (Chang Jiang or the Yangtze River) the longest river in China.</p>
<p>Cheung Kong Holdings was publicly listed in Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1972. During board meetings, Li stated on a number of occasions his goal of surpassing the Jardines-owned Hongkong Land as a leading developer.</p>
<p>The successful bid by Cheung Kong for development sites above the Central and Admiralty MTR stations in 1977 was the key to challenging Hongkong Land as the premier property developer in Hong Kong. Despite its size, Jardines decided in the 1980s to protect itself from hostile takeover by Li or other outside investors. The company implemented a cross-shareholding structure that was designed to place control in the hands of Britain's Keswick family despite their less than 10% holdings in the group. In 1984, the company also moved its legal domicile from Hong Kong to another British overseas territory &ndash; Bermuda, in anticipation of the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to People's Republic of China in 1997.</p>
<h3><span id="Ports_and_Electricity" class="mw-headline">Ports and Electricity</span></h3>
<p>In 1979, Li closed a unique transaction and acquired his current flagship company, Hutchison Whampoa Limited, from HSBC. The purchase created a massive conglomerate with business interests in multiple industries. The most notable branch of his business is the investment in container port facilities around the world, including in Hong Kong, Canada (Deltaport in Vancouver), China, the United Kingdom, Rotterdam, Panama, Bahamas and many developing countries. In total, Li's businesses handle about 12% of all container port capacity in the world.</p>
<h3><span id="Retail" class="mw-headline">Retail</span></h3>
<p>A subsidiary of CK Hutchison, the A.S. Watson Group (ASW), is a retail operator with over 12,000 stores. Its portfolio encompasses retail brands in Europe such as Superdrug (UK), Marionnaud (France), Kruidvat (Benelux countries), and in Asia including health and beauty retailer Watson's store and wine cellars et al., PARKnSHOP supermarkets (and spin-off brands), and Fortress electrical appliance stores. ASW also produces and distributes water products and beverages in the region.</p>
<h3><span id="Asset_Trader" class="mw-headline">Asset Trader</span></h3>
<p>CK Hutchison group has the reputation of being an astute asset trader. It builds up new businesses and sells them off when shareholder value could be created. Huge profits were obtained in the sale of its interest in Orange to Mannesmann Group in 1999, making a profit of $15.12&nbsp;billion. In 2006 Li sold 20% of Hutchison's ports business to Singapore rival PSA Corp., making a $3.12&nbsp;billion profit on a $4&nbsp;billion deal.</p>
<p>Group subsidiary Hutchison Telecommunications sold a controlling stake of 67% in Hutchison Essar, a joint venture Mobile operator in India, to Vodafone for $11.1&nbsp;billion. It had invested roughly $2&nbsp;billion earlier.</p>
<h3><span id="Internet_and_Technology" class="mw-headline">Internet and Technology</span></h3>
<p>Li has also made a foray into the technology business, where his investment and venture capital firm Horizons Ventures is specifically allocated towards backing new internet and technology startup firms, and bought a stake in doubleTwist.&nbsp;His other firm, the Li Ka Shing Foundation bought a 0.8% stake in social networking website Facebook for $120&nbsp;million in two separate rounds,&nbsp;and invested an estimated $50&nbsp;million in the music streaming service Spotify.</p>
<p>Some time between late 2009 and early 2010, Li Ka-shing led a $15.5&nbsp;million Series B round of financing for Siri Inc.</p>
<p>In 2011, Horizons Ventures invested in Summly, a website-summarizing app. Notably, the investment made Nick D'Aloisio, Summly's founder, the world's youngest person to receive a venture capital investment at just fifteen years old.</p>
<p>In 2012, Horizons Ventures invested $2.3&nbsp;million in Wibbitz, a company that provides a text-to-video technology that can automatically convert any article post or feed on the web into a video in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>In August 2012, Li acquired a stake in Ginger Software Incorporated.</p>
<p>In 2013, Horizons Ventures invested in Bitcoin payment company BitPay.</p>
<p>In February 2015, Horizons Ventures participated in a $30&nbsp;million Series C funding round in Zoom Video Communications.</p>
<h3><span id="Australian_Tax_Dispute" class="mw-headline">Australian Tax Dispute</span></h3>
<p>In 2013 a claim was lodged by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) against Cheung Kong Infrastructure (CKI) to pay approximately A$370 million in unpaid tax, penalties and interest relating to tax disputes concerning SA Power Networks and Victoria Power Networks.</p>
<p>The dispute was resolved in 2015 when CKI entered into an agreement with the ATO. No penalty was levied against CKI and a sum of approximately A$24 million was refunded from the A$64 million previously paid to the ATO by CTI.</p>
<h3><span id="Others" class="mw-headline">Others</span></h3>
<p>Besides business through his flagship companies Cheung Kong Property Holdings and CK Hutchison Holdings Limited, Li Ka-shing has also personally invested extensively in real estate in Singapore and Canada. He was the single largest shareholder of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), the fifth largest bank in Canada, until the sale of his share in 2005 (with all proceedings donated, see below). He is also the majority shareholder of a major energy company, Husky Energy, based in Alberta, Canada.</p>
<p>In January 2005, Li announced plans to sell his $1.2&nbsp;billion CAD stake in the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, with all proceeds going to private charitable foundations established by Li, including the Li Ka Shing Foundation in Hong Kong and the Li Ka Shing (Canada) Foundation based in Toronto.</p>
<p>Li was the non-executive director of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation since 1980 and became Deputy Chairman of the bank in 1985. He was also Deputy Chairman of HSBC Holdings in 1991&ndash;1992.</p>

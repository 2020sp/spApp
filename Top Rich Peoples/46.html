Efforts include altering school schedules, curriculums and technologies in order to replace the country's century-old high school education model. Funding for XQ comes from Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective. Following an initial $50 million financial contribution,&nbsp;XQ announced an additional contribution, awarding ten schools $10 million each, for a total financial contribution of $100 million.&nbsp;The schools were chosen from approximately 700 submissions nationwide.&nbsp;Powell Jobs' team of advisors is led by Russlynn H.

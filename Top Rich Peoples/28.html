<p><strong>Philip Hampson</strong> "<strong>Phil</strong>" <strong>Knight</strong> (born February 24, 1938) is an American business magnate and philanthropist. A native of Oregon, he is the co-founder and chairman <em>emeritus</em> of Nike, Inc., and previously served as chairman and CEO of the company.&nbsp;In November 2015, Forbes named Knight the 15th richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$28.1 billion.&nbsp;He is also the owner of the stop motion film production company Laika.</p>
<p>A graduate of the University of Oregon and Stanford Graduate School of Business (Stanford GSB), he has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to both schools; Knight gave the largest donation in history at the time to Stanford's business school in 2006. In 2016, he again matched the record for the largest individual donation ever to a university with a $400 million gift to Stanford's new Knight-Hennessy Scholars Program.&nbsp;He ran track under coach Bill Bowerman at the University of Oregon, with whom he would co-found Nike.</p>
<h2><span id="Early_life" class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Knight was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of lawyer turned newspaper publisher Bill Knight, and his wife Lota (Hatfield) Knight.&nbsp;Knight grew up in the Portland neighborhood of Eastmoreland, and attended Cleveland High School. According to one source, "When his father refused to give him a summer job at his newspaper, the <em>Oregon Journal</em>, believing that his son should find work on his own, Phil went to the rival, <em>The Oregonian</em>, where he worked the night shift tabulating sports scores every morning and running home the full seven miles."</p>
<p>Knight continued his education at the University of Oregon (UO) in Eugene, where he is a graduate brother of Phi Gamma Delta ("FIJI") fraternity, was a sports reporter for the <em>Oregon Daily Emeral</em>&nbsp;and earned a journalism degree in 1959.</p>
<p>As a middle-distance runner at UO, his personal best was 1 mile (1.6&nbsp;km) in 4 minutes, 10 seconds,&nbsp;and he won varsity letters for his track performances in 1957, 1958 and 1959. In 1977, together with Bowerman and Geoff Hollister, Knight founded an American running team called Athletics West.</p>
<h2><span id="Career" class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Early_career" class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h3>
<p>Before the Blue Ribbon Sports business that would later become Nike flourished, Knight was a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), firstly with Price Waterhouse, and then Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Knight then became an accounting professor at Portland State University (PSU).</p>
<h3><span id="Nike_Inc." class="mw-headline">Nike Inc.</span></h3>
<p>Immediately after graduating from the University of Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served one year on active duty and seven years in the Army Reserve.&nbsp;After the year of active duty, he enrolled at Stanford Graduate School of Business.&nbsp;In Frank Shallenberger's Small Business class, Knight developed a love affair with something besides sports&nbsp;&mdash; he discovered he was an entrepreneur. Knight recalls in a <em>Stanford Magazine</em> article;&nbsp;"That class was an 'aha!' moment ... Shallenberger defined the type of person who was an entrepreneur--and I realized he was talking to me. I remember after saying to myself: 'This is really what I would like to do.'" In this class, Knight needed to create a business plan. His paper, "Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?," essentially was the premise to his foray into selling running shoes. He graduated with a master's degree in business administration from the school in 1962.</p>
<p>Knight set out on a trip around the world after graduation, during which he made a stop in Kobe, Japan, in November 1962. It was there he discovered the Tiger-brand running shoes, manufactured in Kobe by the Onitsuka Co. So impressed was he with the quality and low cost, Knight made a cold call on Mr. Onitsuka, who agreed to meet with him. By the end of the meeting, Knight had secured Tiger distribution rights for the western United States.</p>
<p>The first Tiger samples would take more than a year to be shipped to Knight, during which time he found a job as an accountant in Portland. When Knight finally received the shoe samples, he mailed two pairs to Bowerman at UO, hoping to gain both a sale and an influential endorsement. To Knight's surprise, Bowerman not only ordered the Tiger shoes, but also offered to become a partner with Knight and provide product design ideas. The two men agreed to a partnership by handshake on January 25, 1964, the birth date of Blue Ribbon Sports, the company name that would later be transformed into Nike.</p>
<p>Knight's first sales were made out of a now legendary green Plymouth Valiant automobile at track meets across the Pacific Northwest. By 1969, these early sales allowed Knight to leave his accountant job and work full-time for Blue Ribbon Sports.</p>
<p>Jeff Johnson, a friend of Knight, suggested calling the firm "Nike," named after the Greek winged goddess of victory. Nike's "swoosh" logo, now considered one of the most powerful logos in the world, was commissioned for a mere US$35 from Carolyn Davidson in 1971.&nbsp;According to Nike's website, Knight said at the time: "I don't love it, but it will grow on me." In September 1983, Davidson was given an undisclosed amount of Nike stock for her contribution to the company's brand. On the <em>Oprah</em> television program in April 2011, Knight claimed he gave Davidson "A few hundred shares" when the company went public.</p>
<h3><span id="Vinton_Studios.2FLaika" class="mw-headline">Vinton Studios/Laika</span></h3>
<p>Following mainstream success in the late 1990s, the animation company Will Vinton Studios experienced very rapid growth and Vinton needed to court external investors&mdash;Knight was one of the wealthy businessmen that he approached. Knight subsequently assumed a 15 percent stake in the company in 1998 and facilitated the employment of his son Travis, who had graduated from PSU following an unsuccessful attempt at a rap music career, as an animator.</p>
<p>Following a period of severe mismanagement, Knight eventually purchased Will Vinton Studios and assumed control of the company's board with the cooperation of Nike executives. In late 2003, Knight appointed his son to the board, who had proven himself as an adept animator since joining the company, and after Vinton stepped down from the board&mdash;prior to leaving the company with a severance package&mdash;Knight rebranded the company Laika. Knight invested US$180 million into Laika following Vinton's departure and the studio released its first feature film, <em>Coraline</em> (in stop motion), in 2009. <em>Coraline</em> was a financial success and Travis Knight was promoted into the roles of Laika CEO and President in the same year.</p>
<h3><span id="Death_of_Matthew_Knight" class="mw-headline">Death of Matthew Knight</span></h3>
<p>In May 2004, two years after Knight bought Vinton, his son Matthew, aged 34 years, traveled to El Salvador to film a fund-raising video for Christian Children of the World, a Portland nonprofit organization. However, while scuba diving with colleagues in Lake Ilopango, near San Salvador, he died immediately from a heart attack 65 feet (20&nbsp;m) underwater due to an undetected congenital heart defect. Knight and Travis traveled to El Salvador to return Matthew Knight's body to the U.S. and Travis explained in 2007, "It brought the family closer. You realize all this can go away in a minute."&nbsp;Laika Studio's 2005 short film <em>Moongirl</em> was dedicated to Matthew's memory.</p>
<p>Knight resigned as the CEO of Nike on November 18, 2004, several months after his son Matthew's funeral,&nbsp;but retained the position of chairman of the board.&nbsp;Knight's replacement was William Perez, former CEO of S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc., who was eventually replaced by Mark Parker in 2006.</p>
<h2><span id="Philanthropy" class="mw-headline">Philanthropy</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Stanford_University" class="mw-headline">Stanford University</span></h3>
<p>In 2006, Knight donated US$105 million to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which, at the time, was the largest ever individual donation to an American business school. The campus was named "The Knight Management Center," in honor of Knight's philanthropic service to the school.</p>
<p>In 2016, it was announced that Knight contributed $400 million to start the new Knight-Hennessy Scholars graduate-level education program. The program will admit up to 100 students with demonstrated leadership and civic commitment each year and is modeled after the Rhodes Scholarship.&nbsp;Over 80% of the endowment will cover living expenses and education at one of the seven graduate schools at Stanford; the graduates are charged to tackle global challenges such as climate change and poverty. The first class of 50 will be admitted in fall 2018.&nbsp;The scholars' academic experience will focus on both subject-specific knowledge and leadership development so that they become prepared to address global challenges.</p>
<h3><span id="University_of_Oregon" class="mw-headline">University of Oregon</span></h3>
<p>Knight has donated tens of millions of dollars to the University of Oregon's academic side. Major gifts include funds supporting the renovation of the Knight Library and construction of the Knight Law Center. Knight also established endowed chairs across the campus.&nbsp;In the fall of 2016, it was announced that Knight will donate $500 million to UO for a new three-building laboratory and research science complex.&nbsp;This donation was part of a series of large higher-education gifts.</p>
<h4><span id="Oregon_Ducks" class="mw-headline">Oregon Ducks</span></h4>
<p>In August 2007, Knight announced that he and his wife would be donating US$100 million to found the UO Athletics Legacy Fund to help support all athletic programs at the university. In response, Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny said: "This extraordinary gift will set Oregon athletics on a course toward certain self sufficiency and create the flexibility and financial capacity for the university to move forward with the new athletic arena." At the time, the donation was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the university.</p>
<p>The 2010 construction of the UO basketball team's facility, Matthew Knight Arena, was the result of a partnership between Knight and former Oregon Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny. Although Knight didn't pay for the project directly, he established a $100 million "Athletic Legacy Fund." The fund supports the athletic department.&nbsp;Named after Knight's deceased son, the venue replaced the McArthur Court building and its cost of over US$200 million to build. The facility was built using bonds backed by the State of Oregon.</p>
<p>Knight was responsible for financing the UO's US$68 million 145,000 square-foot gridiron football facility that was officially opened in late July 2013. Knight's personal locker in the team's locker room displays the title "Uncle Phil", and other features include a gym with Brazilian hardwood floors, Apple iPhone chargers in each of the player's lockers, various auditoriums and meeting rooms, a games room for the players that includes flat-screen televisions and table football machines, and a cafeteria.</p>
<p>In November 2015, it was announced that Knight and his wife would be donating $19.2 million towards a new sports complex project at the University of Oregon. The plans for the 29,000 square foot complex was announced in September. Construction will begin in January 2016 and end in September 2016.</p>
<h2><span id="Accolades" class="mw-headline">Accolades</span></h2>
<p>In 2000, Knight was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for his Special Contribution to Sports in Oregon.&nbsp;At the time of his induction, he had contributed approximately US$230 million to UO, the majority of which was for athletics.</p>
<p>On February 24, 2012, Knight was announced as a 2012 inductee of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor. The Hall recognized him as the driving force behind Nike's huge financial support of U.S. basketball and its players. Knight was formally inducted on September 7, 2012.</p>
<p>For his "contributions to business, corporate and philanthropic leadership", Knight was elected to the 2015 American Academy of Arts and Sciences membership class.</p>

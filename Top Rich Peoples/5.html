<p><strong>Mark Elliot Zuckerberg</strong> (<span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/mɑɹk_ˈɛli̯ət ˈzʌkʰɚbɚg/</span>, born May 14, 1984) is an American computer programmer and Internet entrepreneur. He is the chairman, chief executive officer, and co-founder of Facebook.&nbsp;His net worth is estimated to be US $53.6 billion as of 2017, ranking him the 5th richest person in the world.</p>
<p>Zuckereberg launched Facebook from Harvard's dormitory rooms on February 4, 2004. He was assisted by his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.&nbsp;The group then introduced Facebook to other college campuses.</p>
<p>Facebook expanded rapidly, reaching one billion users by 2012. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg was involved in various legal disputes that were initiated by others in the group, who claimed a share of the company based upon their involvement during the development phase of Facebook.</p>
<p>In December 2012, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan announced that over the course of their lives they would give the majority of their wealth to "advancing human potential and promoting equality" in the spirit of The Giving Pledge.&nbsp;On December 1, 2015, they announced they would eventually give 99% of their Facebook shares (worth about $45 billion at the time) to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.</p>
<p>Since 2010, <em>Time</em> magazine has named Zuckerberg among the 100 wealthiest and most influential people in the world as a part of its Person of the Year distinction.&nbsp;In December 2016, Zuckerberg was ranked 10th on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People.&nbsp;According to <em>Forbes Magazine</em>, Zuckerberg has a net worth of $55.9 billion USD as of February 2017.</p>
<h2><span id="Early_life" class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Zuckerberg was born in 1984 in White Plains, New York.&nbsp;He is the son of Karen (Kempner), a psychiatrist, and Edward Zuckerberg, a dentist.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference">[17]</sup> His ancestors came from Germany, Austria and Poland.&nbsp;He and his three sisters, Randi, Donna, and Arielle,&nbsp;were brought up in Dobbs Ferry, New York, a small Westchester County village about 21 miles north of Midtown Manhattan.&nbsp;Zuckerberg was raised Jewish and had his bar mitzvah when he turned&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Ardsley High School, Zuckerberg excelled in classes. He transferred to the exclusive private school Phillips Exeter Academy, in New Hampshire, in his junior year, where he won prizes in science (math, astronomy, and physics) and classical studies. On his college application, Zuckerberg claimed that he could read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was captain of the fencing team.</p>
<h3><span id="Early_years" class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h3>
<p>Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. His father taught him Atari BASIC Programming in the 1990s, and later hired software developer David Newman to tutor him privately. Newman calls him a "prodigy", adding that it was "tough to stay ahead of him". Zuckerberg took a graduate course in the subject at Mercy College near his home while still in high school. He enjoyed developing computer programs, especially communication tools and games. In one program, since his father's dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called "ZuckNet" that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. It is considered a "primitive" version of AOL's Instant Messenger, which came out the following year.</p>
<p>According to writer Jose Antonio Vargas, "some kids played computer games. Mark created them." Zuckerberg himself recalls this period: "I had a bunch of friends who were artists. They'd come over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game out of it." However, notes Vargas, Zuckerberg was not a typical "geek-klutz", as he later became captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma. Napster co-founder Sean Parker, a close friend, notes that Zuckerberg was "really into Greek odysseys and all that stuff", recalling how he once quoted lines from the Roman epic poem <em>Aeneid</em>, by Virgil, during a Facebook product conference.</p>
<p>During Zuckerberg's high school years, he worked under the company name Intelligent Media Group to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to <em>Slashdot</em>&nbsp;and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from <em>PC Magazine</em>.</p>
<h3><span id="College_years" class="mw-headline">College years</span></h3>
<p>argas noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard, he had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy". He studied psychology and computer science and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland House.&nbsp;In his sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best looking person from a choice of photos. According to Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, "he built the site for fun". Hasit explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures, or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The site went up over a weekend; but by Monday morning, the college shut it down because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely improper.</p>
<p>The following semester, in January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website.<sup id="cite_ref-Hoffman.2C_Claire_30-0" class="reference">]</sup> On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.</p>
<p>Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.&nbsp;The three complained to <em>The Harvard Crimson</em>, and the newspaper began an investigation in response.</p>
<p>Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement.&nbsp;The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares that were worth US$300 million at Facebook's IPO.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year to complete his project.&nbsp;In January 2014, Zuckerberg recalled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember really vividly, you know, having pizza with my friends a day or two after&mdash;I opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, "You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world." But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of what it comes down to is we just cared more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span id="Facebook" class="mw-headline">Facebook</span></h3>
<p>Zuckerberg launched Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room on February 4, 2004.&nbsp;An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, "The Photo Address Book", which students referred to as "The Facebook". Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.</p>
<p>Once at college, Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a "Harvard thing" until Zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate Dustin Moskovitz. They began with Columbia, New York University, Stanford, Dartmouth, Cornell, Penn, Brown, and Yale.&nbsp;Samyr Laine, a triple jumper representing Haiti at the 2012 Summer Olympics, shared a room with Zuckerberg during Facebook's founding. "Mark was clearly on to great things," said Laine, who was Facebook's fourteenth user.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><span id="Philanthropy" class="mw-headline">Philanthropy</span></h2>
<p>After Zuckerberg, Moskovitz and some friends moved to Palo Alto, California, they leased a small house that served as an office. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met Peter Thiel who invested in the company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard but eventually decided to remain in California.&nbsp;They had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company. In an interview in 2007, Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: "It's not because of the amount of money. For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me."</p>
<p>He restated these goals to <em>Wired</em> magazine in 2010: "The thing I really care about is the mission, making the world open."&nbsp;Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg sought the advice of former Netscape CFO Peter Currie about financing strategies for Facebook.&nbsp;On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark.When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth, he explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I guess we could..... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads..... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we aren't like that. We make enough money. Right, I mean, we are keeping things running; we are growing at the rate we want to.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2010, Steven Levy, who wrote the 1984 book <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em>, wrote that Zuckerberg "clearly thinks of himself as a hacker". Zuckerberg said that "it's OK to break things" "to make them better".&nbsp;Facebook instituted "hackathons" held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project.&nbsp;The company provided music, food, and beer at the hackathons, and many Facebook staff members, including Zuckerberg, regularly attended.&nbsp;"The idea is that you can build something really good in a night", Zuckerberg told Levy. "And that's part of the personality of Facebook now..... It's definitely very core to my personality."</p>
<p><em>Vanity Fair</em> magazine named Zuckerberg number 1 on its 2010 list of the Top 100 "most influential people of the Information Age"&nbsp;Zuckerberg ranked number 23 on the <em>Vanity Fair</em> 100 list in 2009.In 2010, Zuckerberg was chosen as number 16 in <em>New Statesman</em><span class="nowrap">'</span>s annual survey of the world's 50 most influential figures.</p>
<p>In a 2011 interview with PBS shortly after the death of Steve Job<a title="Steve Jobs" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">s</a>, Zuckerberg said that Jobs had advised him on how to create a management team at Facebook that was "focused on building as high quality and good things as you are".</p>
<p>On October 1, 2012, Zuckerberg visited Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market.&nbsp;Russia's communications minister tweeted that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged the social media giant's founder to abandon plans to lure away Russian programmers and instead consider opening a research center in Moscow. In 2012, Facebook had roughly 9 million users in Russia, while domestic clone VK had around 34 million.Rebecca Van Dyck, Facebook's head of consumer marketing, claimed that 85 million American Facebook users were exposed to the first day of the Home promotional campaign on April 6, 2013.</p>
<p>On August 19, 2013, the <em>Washington Post</em> reported that Zuckerberg's Facebook profile was hacked by an unemployed web developer.</p>
<p>At the 2013 TechCrunch Disrupt conference, held in September, Zuckerberg stated that he is working towards registering the 5 billion humans who were not connected to the Internet as of the conference on Facebook. Zuckerberg then explained that this is intertwined with the aim of the Internet.org project, whereby Facebook, with the support of other technology companies, seeks to increase the number of people connected to the internet.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg was the keynote speaker at the 2014 Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in Barcelona, Spain, in March 2014, which was attended by 75,000 delegates. Various media sources highlighted the connection between Facebook's focus on mobile technology and Zuckerberg's speech, claiming that mobile represents the future of the company.&nbsp;Zuckerberg's speech expands upon the goal that he raised at the TechCrunch conference in September 2013, whereby he is working towards expanding Internet coverage into developing countries.</p>
<p>Alongside other American technology figures like Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook, Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician Lu Wei, known as the "Internet czar" for his influence in the enforcement of China's online policy, at Facebook's headquarters on December 8, 2014. The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q&amp;A session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he attempted to converse in Mandarin Chinese&mdash;although Facebook is banned in China, Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation's burgeoning entrepreneur sector.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg fielded questions during a live Q&amp;A session at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11, 2014. The founder and CEO explained that he does not believe Facebook is a waste of time because it facilitates social engagement, and participating in a public session was so that he could "learn how to better serve the community".</p>
<p>Zuckerberg receives a one-dollar salary as CEO of Facebook.&nbsp;On December 3, 2016 Forbes reported Facebook shares have declined 7% since November 8, 2016, reducing Zuckerberg's net worth by 3.7 billion dollars.In June 2016, Business Insider named Zuckerberg one of the "Top 10 Business Visionaries Creating Value for the World" along with Elon Musk and Sal Khan, due to the fact that he and his wife "pledged to give away 99% of their wealth &mdash; which is estimated at over $52.1 billion.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, i2hub, another campus-only service, created by Wayne Chang, was launched. i2hub focused on peer-to-peer file sharing. At the time, both i2hub and Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. In August 2004, Zuckerberg, Andrew McCollum, Adam D'Angelo, and Sean Parker launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called Wirehog, a precursor to Facebook Platform applications.</p>

<p>On May 24, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Facebook Platform, a development platform for programmers to create social applications within Facebook. Within weeks, many applications had been built and some already had millions of users. It grew to more than 800,000 developers around the world building applications for Facebook Platform.</p>
<p>On November 6, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Beacon, a social advertising system that enabled people to share information with their Facebook friends based on their browsing activities on other sites. For example, eBay sellers could let friends know automatically what they have for sale via the Facebook news feed as they listed items for sale. The program came under scrutiny because of privacy concerns from groups and individual users. Zuckerberg and Facebook failed to respond to the concerns quickly, and on December 5, 2007, Zuckerberg wrote a blog post on Facebook,&nbsp;taking responsibility for the concerns about Beacon and offering an easier way for users to opt out of the service.</p>
<p>In 2007, Zuckerberg was named by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Technology Review's TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.&nbsp;On July 23, 2008, Zuckerberg announced Facebook Connect, a version of Facebook Platform for users.</p>
<h3><span id="Internet.org" class="mw-headline">Internet.org</span></h3>
<p>In a public Facebook post, Zuckerberg launched the Internet.org project in late August 2013. Zuckerberg explained that the primary aim of the initiative is to provide Internet access to the 5 billion people who are not connected as of the launch date. Using a three-tier strategy, Internet.org will also create new jobs and open up new markets, according to Zuckerberg. He stated in his post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world economy is going through a massive transition right now. The knowledge economy is the future. By bringing everyone online, we'll not only improve billions of lives, but we'll also improve our own as we benefit from the ideas and productivity they contribute to the world. Giving everyone the opportunity to connect is the foundation for enabling the knowledge economy. It is not the only thing we need to do, but it's a fundamental and necessary step</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To stay proven on the efforts of bringing in the concept of net neutrality, Mark Zuckerberg met Narendra Modi, Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai at the Silicon Valley, to discuss on how to effectively establish affordable internet access to the less developed countries.&nbsp;As a token of initiation, Mark Zuckerberg changed his Facebook profile picture to extend his support to the Digital India to help the rural communities to stay connected to the internet.</p>
<h2><span id="Politics" class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>
<p>n 2002, Zuckerberg registered to vote in Westchester County, New York, where he grew up, but did not cast a ballot until November 2008. Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters Spokeswoman, Elma Rosas, told Bloomberg that Zuckerberg is listed as &ldquo;no preference&rdquo; on voter rolls, and he voted in the past two general elections, in 2008 and 2012.&nbsp;On Zuckerberg's Facebook page, he has Chris Christie, Cory Booker, Nicolas Sarkozy, and Barack Obama in his likes section.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg has never revealed his own political views: some consider him a conservative,&nbsp;while others consider him liberal.</p>
<p>On February 13, 2013, Zuckerberg hosted his first ever fundraising event for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Zuckerberg's particular interest on this occasion was education reform, and Christie's education reform work focused on teachers unions and the expansion of charter schools.&nbsp;Later that year, Zuckerberg hosted a campaign fundraiser for Newark mayor Cory Booker, who was running in the 2013 New Jersey special Senate election.&nbsp;In September 2010, with the support of Governor Chris Christie, Booker obtained a $100 million pledge from Zuckerberg to Newark Public Schools&nbsp;In December 2012, Zuckerberg donated 18 million shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a community organization that includes education in its list of grant-making areas.</p>
<p>On April 11, 2013, Zuckerberg led the launch of a 501(c)(4) lobbying group called FWD.us. The founders and contributors to the group were primarily Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors, and its president was Joe Green, a close friend of Zuckerberg.&nbsp;The goals of the group include immigration reform, improving the state of education in the US, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public,&nbsp;yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline.&nbsp;In 2013, numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as The League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club, Democracy for America, CREDO, Daily Kos, 350.org, and Presente and Progressives United agreed to either pull their Facebook ad buys or not buy Facebook ads for at least two weeks, in protest of Zuckerberg ads funded by FWD.us that were in support of oil drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline, and in opposition to Obamacare among Republican US senators who back immigration reform.</p>
<p>A media report on June 20, 2013 revealed that Zuckerberg actively engaged with Facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a FWD.us video. In response to a claim that the FWD.us organization is "just about tech wanting to hire more people", the Internet entrepreneur replied: "The bigger problem we&rsquo;re trying to address is ensuring the 11 million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly.</p>
<p>In June 2013, Zuckerberg joined Facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Celebration. The company first participated in the event in 2011, with 70 employees, and this number increased to 700 for the 2013 march. The 2013 pride celebration was especially significant, as it followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that deemed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional.</p>
<p>When questioned about the mid-2013 PRISM scandal at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September 2013, Zuckerberg stated that the U.S. government "blew it." He further explained that the government performed poorly in regard to the protection of the freedoms of its citizens, the economy, and companies.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg placed a statement on his Facebook wall on December 9, 2015 which said that he wants "to add my voice in support of Muslims in our community and around the world" in response to the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks and the 2015 San Bernardino attack.&nbsp;The statement also said that Muslims are "always welcome" on Facebook, and that his position was a result of the fact that "as a Jew, my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities."</p>
<p>On February 24, 2016, Zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten "Black Lives Matter" phrases on the company walls and had written "All Lives Matter" in their place. Facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. The memo was then leaked by several employees. As Zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but "malicious as well." According to Zuckerberg's memo, "<em>Black Lives Matter</em> doesn't mean other lives don't -- it's simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve." The memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself, "means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's." Zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents.&nbsp;The <em>New York Daily News</em> interviewed Facebook employees who commented anonymously that, "Zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that Zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase 'Black Lives Matter' must exist, as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and erasure."</p>

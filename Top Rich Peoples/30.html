	<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Ma Huateng</h1>
<p><strong>Ma Huateng</strong> (Chinese: &nbsp;pinyin: <em><span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Mǎ Hu&agrave;t&eacute;ng</span></em>, born October 29, 1971), also known as <strong>Pony Ma</strong>, is a Chinese internet entrepreneur. He is the founder, president, chief executive officer and executive board member of Tencent Inc., one of the largest Internet companies in China.&nbsp;The company controls China&rsquo;s biggest mobile instant messaging service and its subsidiaries provide media, entertainment, internet and mobile phone value-added services.</p>
<p>In 2007 and 2014&nbsp;<em>Time</em> magazine called him one of the world's most influential people.&nbsp;As of 11 November 2016 he is the 30th richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$23.9 billion, according to the Forbes Global Rich List.</p>
<h2><span id="Early_life_and_education" class="mw-headline">Early life and education</span></h2>
<p>Ma was born in Chaoyang District, Shantou, Guangdong. Not much is known about his early life. In one rare insight into his own psyche, Ma claimed in an interview that as a child he dreamt of becoming an astronomer.&nbsp;When his father, Ma Chenshu, got a job as a port manager in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, the young Ma accompanied him.&nbsp;His father was a member of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>He enrolled in Shenzhen University in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. He graduated in 1993 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.</p>
<p>Ma&rsquo;s first job was with China Motion Telecom Development, a supplier of telecommunications services and products, where he was in charge of developing software for pagers. He reportedly earned $176 per month.&nbsp;He also worked for Shenzhen Runxun Communications Co. Ltd. in the research and development department for Internet calling services.</p>
<h2><span id="Founding_of_Tencent_and_early_career" class="mw-headline">Founding of Tencent and early career</span></h2>
<p>Alongside four other classmates, Ma Huateng went on to co-found <strong>Tencent</strong> in 1998, after making money playing the stock market.&nbsp;In the beginning, Ma took up various roles, ranging from janitor to website designer in a bid to keep the company alive.&nbsp;Like many in China&rsquo;s tech industry, Ma was inspired by innovations coming out of Europe and the United States and sought to adapt them to the Chinese market. The company&rsquo;s first product came after Ma participated in a presentation for ICQ, the world&rsquo;s first Internet instant messaging service, founded in 1996 by an Israeli company.&nbsp;Inspired by the idea, Ma and his team launched in February 1999 a similar software, with a Chinese interface and a slightly different name &ndash; OICQ (or, Open ICQ).&nbsp;The product quickly became popular and garnered more than a million registered users by the end of 1999, making it one of the largest such services in China.</p>
<p>Talking about the founding of Tencent, he told The China Daily in a 2009 interview that &ldquo;If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants,&rdquo; paraphrasing a quote attributed to Isaac Newton and referencing the similarities between ICQ and OICQ. "We knew our product had a future, but at that time we just couldn't afford it," Ma remembered.&nbsp;In order to solve the problem, Ma asked for bank loans and even talked about selling the company.</p>
<p>Since Tencent's prized service QICQ was offered free of charge, the company looked to venture capitalists to finance its growing operational costs. In 2000, Ma turned to US investment firm IDC and Hong Kong&rsquo;s telecom carrier Pacific Century CyberWorks (PCCW) who bought 40% of Tencent&rsquo;s shares for $2.2 million.&nbsp;With the pager market declining, Ma improved the messaging platform by allowing QQ users to send messages to mobile handsets. Afterwards, 80% of the company&rsquo;s revenue came from deals struck with telecom operators who agreed to share message fees.</p>
<h2><span id="AOL_lawsuit_and_global_fame" class="mw-headline">AOL lawsuit and global fame</span></h2>
<p>After AOL (America Online) bought ICQ in 1998, the company filed a lawsuit against Tencent with the National Arbitration Forum in the United States, claiming that QICQ&rsquo;s domain names QICQ.com and QICQ.net were in violation of ICQ&rsquo;s intellectual property rights. Tencent lost and had to shut down the websites.&nbsp;In December 2000, in order to stave off other costly lawsuit, Ma changed the name of the software to QQ (with "Q" and "QQ" used to stand for the word "cute")</p>
<p>After the AOL lawsuit, Ma Huateng decided to expand the business portfolio of Tencent. In 2003, Tencent released its own portal (QQ.com) and made forays into the online games market. By 2004, Tencent became the largest Chinese instant messaging service (holding 74% of the market),&nbsp;prompting Ma to list the company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.&nbsp;After the company raised $200 million in June&rsquo;s IPO, Ma quickly became one of the richest people in China&rsquo;s telecom industry.</p>
<p>In 2004, Tencent launched an online gaming platform and started selling virtual goods to support the games published on that platform (weapons, gaming power), as well as emoticons and ringtones.</p>
<p>At Ma&rsquo;s behest, Tencent launched in 2005 the C2C platform Paipai.com, a direct competitor to e-ecommerce giant Alibaba.</p>
<p>Mimicking Bill Gates&rsquo; Microsoft, Ma Huateng created two competing teams of engineers in 2010 and charged them with creating a new product. After two months, one team presented an app for text messaging and group chat &ndash; Weixin &ndash; which launched in January 2011. In 2015, Weixin (or WeChat in English), is the largest instant messaging platform in the world, used by 48% of all Internet users.</p>
<p>Other diverse services provided by Tencent include web portals, e-commerce, and multiplayer online games.&nbsp;Online games such as Legend of Yulong and Legend of Xuanyuan boosted revenue by more than half, up to US$ 5.1 billion, with a US$ 1.5 billion profit margin.</p>
<p>In December 2015, Ma Huateng announced that Tencent will build an "internet hospital" set up in Wuzhen that will provide long-distance diagnoses and medicine delivery.</p>

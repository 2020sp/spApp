<p>Chearavanont was born in 1939,&nbsp;the fourth and youngest son of Chia Ek Chor.</p>
<p>Dhanin Chearavanont's father, Chia Ek Chor, and uncle, Chia Seow Hui, left China for Bangkok in the 1920s to begin selling seeds and agricultural chemicals. Their business diversified geographically across Asia, and vertically via a number of technology ventures and contract farming initiatives. In the 1980s, as China opened up to foreign firms, the Charoen Pokphand Group became the preferred partner for international brands such as Honda, Wal Mart, and Tesco.</p>
<p>Dhanin, his three brothers (Jaran, Montri and Sumet) and their families collectively own the Charoen Pokhphand Group (CP Group). CP Group's holdings generated cumulative revenues of approximately $7.5 billion and holds about $5.6 billion in assets. It is the largest shareholder in Ping An Insurance, a Chinese life insurance company with $9 billion in assets (2012). The CP Group is also the second largest shareholder in Itochu Corporation of Japan. Itochu reported revenues of over $11 billion in FY2013.</p>
<p>The CP Group is one of Asia's largest conglomerates and operates in agriculture, telecommunications, marketing, distribution and logistics, international trading, petrochemicals, property and land development, crop integration, insurance, automotive, and pet foods.</p>

<p>Sheikh <strong>Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum</strong> (Arabic: محمد بن راشد آل مكتوم; <span class="Unicode" title="Arabic transliteration"><em>Muḥammad bin Rāshid al Maktūm</em></span>; born 15 July 1949), is the vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Emir of Dubai.&nbsp;Since his accession in 2006, after the death of his brother Sheikh Maktoum, he has undertaken reforms in the UAE's government, starting with the UAE Federal Government Strategy in April, 2007. In 2010 he launched the UAE vision 2021 with the aim of making the UAE one of the best countries in the world by 2021.</p>
<p>He is responsible for the growth of Dubai into a global city,&nbsp;as well as the launch of a number of major enterprises including Emirates Airline, DP World, and the Jumeirah Group. Many of these are held by Dubai Holding, a company with multi-diversified businesses and investments. Sheikh Mohammed has overseen the development of numerous projects in Dubai including the creation of a technology park and a free economic zone, Dubai Internet City, Dubai Media City, the Dubai International Finance Centre, the Palm Islands and the iconic Burj Al Arab hotel. He also drove the construction of Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world.</p>
<p>An equestrian, he is the founder of the Maktoum family-owned Godolphin racing stable and the owner of Darley, the thoroughbred breeding operation with operations in six countries. In 2012, he rode the horse <em>Madji Du Pont</em> 160&nbsp;km to take the FEI World Endurance Championship.</p>
<h2><span id="Early_life_and_education" class="mw-headline">Early life and education</span></h2>
<p>Sheikh Mohammed is the third of Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum's four sons, members of Dubai's ruling Al Maktoum family and descendants of the House of Al-Falasi, of which Sheikh Mohammed is the tribal leader.&nbsp;His mother was Sheikha Latifa bint Hamdan al-Nahyan, daughter of Hamdan bin Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi.&nbsp;From the age of four, he was privately tutored in Arabic and Islamic Studies. In 1955, he began his formal education at Al Ahmedia School. At the age of 10, he moved to Al Shaab School, and two years later went to Dubai Secondary School. In 1966, with his cousin Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Maktoum, he attended the Bell Educational Trust's English Language School in the United Kingdom.&nbsp;He subsequently studied at the Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot, (which later became part of Sandhurst), passing out with the sword of honour as the top Commonwealth student.&nbsp;He also travelled to Italy to train as a pilot.</p>
<p>As a young man, in January 1968, he was present when Sheikh Rashid and Sheikh Zayed first met in the desert between Dubai and Abu Dhabi at <em>Argoub El Sedira</em>&nbsp;to agree to the formation of a union of emirates following British notification of intent to withdraw from the Trucial States. When the new nation of the United Arab Emirates was founded on 2 December 1971, he became its first Minister of Defence.</p>
<h3><span id="Minister_for_Defence" class="mw-headline">Minister for Defence</span></h3>
<p>On his return from military training to Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed's father appointed him head of the Dubai Police Force and the Dubai Defence Force, which was later to become part of the Union Defence Force.</p>
<p>A period of uncertainty and instability followed the Union of the United Arab Emirates, including skirmishes between tribes over property straddling new borders. On 24 January 1972, the exiled former ruler of the Emirate of Sharjah, Saqr bin Sultan Al Qasimi led an insurrectionist coup against the ruler, Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi.&nbsp;Following a spirited firefight between the Union Defence Force and Saqr's forces - mostly Egyptian mercenaries who had entered the UAE through Ras Al Khaimah&nbsp;- Sheikh Mohammed accepted Saqr's surrender.&nbsp;Sheikh Khalid had been killed in the action, leading to the accession of his brother Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi as ruler of Sharjah.</p>
<p>In 1973, he was involved in protracted negotiations with the hijackers of JAL 404, led by Japanese Red Army member Osamu Maruouka, which landed in Dubai after being hijacked as it departed Schiphol. Although unsuccessful in obtaining the release of the hostages (they were finally freed, and the 747 blown up, in Libya), he was more successful in a later negotiation with the three hijackers of KLM 861, who released the balance of their hostages and handed over the plane in return for safe passage.</p>
<h2><span id="Business_career" class="mw-headline">Business career</span></h2>
<p>Sheikh Mohammed has been responsible for the creation and growth of a number of businesses and economic assets of Dubai, with a number held by two companies under his ownership, Dubai World and Dubai Holding.</p>
<p>Dubai World was launched on 2 July 2006, as a holding company consolidating a number of assets including logistics company DP World, property developer Nakheel Properties, and investment company Istithmar World. With more than 50,000 employees in over 100 cities around the globe, the group has real estate, logistics and other business investments in the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Dubai Holding develops and manages hospitality, business parks, real estate, and telecommunications through four operating units: Jumeirah Group, TECOM Investments, Dubai Properties Group and Emirates International Telecommunications.&nbsp;The company's investment group operating units include Dubai Group and Dubai International Capital.</p>
<p>He also holds a controlling interest in property developer, asset and event management, and investment company Meraas Holding which is currently developing a number of retail, lifestyle and themed developments in Dubai, including Legoland and a Bollywood movie theme park.</p>
<p>Sheikh Mohammed was responsible for the launch of Emirates Airline, as well as heading the development of both Dubai International Airport and Dubai World Central - Al Maktoum International Airport, the 'world's first purpose-built aerotropolis'. He was also behind the establishment of government-owned low cost carrier FlyDubai.</p>
<h2><span id="Key_businesses" class="mw-headline">Key businesses</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Launch_of_Emirates_Airline" class="mw-headline">Launch of Emirates Airline</span></h3>
<p>Through the 1970s, as well as his role as head of Dubai Defence Force and UAE Minister of Defence, Sheikh Mohammed oversaw Dubai's energy resources and was in charge of Dubai Civil Aviation. It was in this latter role, in March 1985, that he tasked the then head of DNATA, Maurice Flanagan, with launching a new airline to be called Emirates after a dispute with Gulf Air over Dubai's 'Open Skies' policy. The launch budget of the airline was $10 million (the amount Flanagan said he needed to launch an airline) and its inaugural flight took place on 25 October 1985.&nbsp;Sheikh Mohammed made his (younger) uncle, Ahmed bin Saeed chairman of the new company. A further $75 million in facilities and materials was provided, but Emirates has always maintained it has received no further subsidies throughout the company's meteoric growth to become one of the world's leading airlines.</p>
<p>In 1989, Sheikh Mohammed inaugurated the first Dubai Airshow: in 2013 the exhibition had grown to over 1,000 exhibiting companies, and was the venue for Emirates' placement of the largest aeroplane order in history, with $99 billion combined orders with Airbus for its A380 and Boeing for its 777</p>
<h3><span id="Dubai_Ports_World" class="mw-headline">Dubai Ports World</span></h3>
<p>In 1991, Sheikh Mohammed merged the Jebel Ali Port and Free Zone and Port Rashid to form the Dubai Ports Authority. In 1999, he founded Dubai Ports International to explore overseas acquisitions and management contracts which, in 2005, was folded into the Dubai Ports Authority to form DP World. In 2006, the company acquired P&amp;O for $7 billion. The acquisition led to the 'DP World Controversy' after a number of US politicians and lobbyists raised concerns regarding the safety of six ports acquired by DP World as part of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O) Acquisition. DP World subsequently divested the ports in question.</p>
<p>A profitable global enterprise, DP World today is one of the largest marine terminal operators in the world. The company operates more than 77 terminals across six continents, with container handling generating some 80% of its revenue.</p>
<h3><span id="The_Burj_Al_Arab_and_Jumeirah" class="mw-headline">The Burj Al Arab and Jumeirah</span></h3>
<p>The Burj Al Arab was inaugurated in December 1999. The hotel, constructed from a design by WS Atkins in response to a brief from Sheikh Mohammed to create a truly iconic building, styles itself as 'the world's most luxurious hotel'&ndash;. It was constructed on an island offshore from the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, the first property managed by Jumeirah,the hotel management company launched by Sheikh Mohammed in 1997 and headed by ex-Trust House Forte executive Gerald Lawless. In fact, work began on both hotels at the same time, but the island to house the Burj Al Arab required three years to build before construction began above ground. Jumeirah's international expansion, driven after it became part of Dubai Holding in 2004,&nbsp;encompasses 22 hotels in ten countries.</p>
<h3><span id="Dubai_Internet_City_and_TECOM" class="mw-headline">Dubai Internet City and TECOM</span></h3>
<p>On 29 October 1999, Sheikh Mohammed announced Dubai Internet City, a technology hub and free trade zone. Offering companies long leases, full ownership, and fast access to government services, DIC grew from its first tenants in October 2000, to a current zone employing some 15,000 people.&nbsp;In November 2000, it was joined by Dubai Media City, a content and media production-free zone which is co-located with DIC. The launch of DIC came with assurances from Sheikh Mohammed regarding media freedoms. In 2007, he issued a decree banning the imprisonment of journalists following an incident in which local journalists were accused of libel and sentenced to jail terms.</p>
<p>A number of other media and technology-related free zones have since been established by holding company TECOM in Dubai, including: the International Media Production Zone, Dubai Silicon Oasis, Dubai Studio City, Dubai Healthcare City, Dubai Industrial City and Dubai Knowledge Village.</p>
<h3><span id="Palm_Islands" class="mw-headline">Palm Islands</span></h3>
<p>Developed by Nakheel Properties, part of Dubai World, the development of the three planned Palm Islands was halted by the global financial crisis of 2009. The first of the islands, the Palm Jumeirah, has been completed and developed, while the second, the Palm Jebel Ali, has completed land reclamation but not been further developed. The third and largest Palm, the Palm Deira, has been scaled back and re-launched as the Deira Islands.</p>
<h3><span id="Burj_Khalifa" class="mw-headline">Burj Khalifa</span></h3>
<p>On 4 January 2010, Sheikh Mohammed opened Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, with a display of some 10,000 fireworks. It forms the centre of the $20 billion downtown Dubai development of mixed use towers, buildings, and retail outlets. The development is also home to the world's largest shopping mall by total area, the Dubai Mall. Originally conceived as a development around an 80-story tower, the project team was sent away to return with "the greatest neighbourhood known to man".&nbsp;He has said of the tower that it is "a national accomplishment, a historic milestone and a key economic turning point. It is a symbol of pride, not only to the Emirati people but to all Arabs."</p>
<h2><span id="Political_reform" class="mw-headline">Political reform</span></h2>
<p>On 3 January 1995, Sheikh Mohammed's elder brother Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum signed two decrees that appointed him Crown Prince of Dubai.</p>
<p>After roughly a decade of de facto rule, he became the Ruler of Dubai on 4 January 2006 upon the death of Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum.&nbsp;The following day, the Federal National Council selected him as the new Vice President of the UAE. On 11 February, the Council approved President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan's nomination of Sheikh Mohammed for Prime Minister.</p>
<p>In April 2007 Sheikh Mohammed announced a strategic review of the Federation's governance at both the Federal and local government levels. The UAE Federal Government Strategy, a process of strategic reform intended to address a lack of co-ordination and strategic planning in government, as well as policy making issues and deficiencies in the legislative and regulatory framework, would work on improvements in social development, economic development, public sector development, justice and safety, infrastructure, and rural development.</p>
<p>This was followed by the announcement in February 2010 of Vision 2021, a long term strategy and national agenda.</p>
<h3><span id="Mohammed_Bin_Rashid_School_of_Government" class="mw-headline">Mohammed Bin Rashid School of Government</span></h3>

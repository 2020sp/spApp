	<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi</strong> (Thai: <span lang="th" xml:lang="th">เจริญ สิริวัฒนภักดี</span>; <span class="smallcaps">rtgs</span>:&nbsp;<span class="Unicode" title="Thai transliteration">Charoen Siriwatthanaphakdi</span>; born 2 May 1944) is a Thai billionaire businessman.</p>
<p>He is the founder of Thai Beverage, the chairman of conglomerate TCC Group and Fraser and Neave, Ltd(F&amp;N).Sirivadhanabhakdi family is now Thailand's largest property developer and landlord of 630,000 rai, plus commercial and retail buildings in Singapore.&nbsp;He also owns 50 hotels in Asia, the US, UK and Australia, including Plaza Ath&eacute;n&eacute;e in Manhattan and The Okura Prestige Bangkok.</p>
<p>In 1988, King Bhumibol of Thailand granted the family the name &ldquo;Sirivadhanabhakdi&rdquo;.</p>
<h2><span id="Early_life" class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Born to a Thai family of Chinese origin, he is the sixth of 11 children of a poor street vendor who migrated to Bangkok from southern China. He left school early, at the age of nine, to work.&nbsp;To this day Charoen speaks Teochew, his native Chinese dialect, as well as Thai.</p>
<h2><span id="Business_career" class="mw-headline">Business career</span></h2>
<p>Charoen started by supplying distilleries producing Thai whiskey, which were a state-run monopoly at the time. Through the contacts he made, he acquired a licence to produce his own alcoholic drinks.&nbsp;All liquor production was state-owned at the time, and Charoen was able to get rights to 15 percent of the market.</p>
<p>In 1985, the remaining 85 percent of state licenses were opened to bids. Charoen was able to take out a US$200 million loan using his large stocks of alcohol as collateral and soon after won 100 percent of the concessions. With this monopoly, Charoen's beverage companies were able to return US$550 million in royalties to Thailand&rsquo;s excise department in 1987, five percent of the national budget at the time.</p>
<h3><span id="Beer" class="mw-headline">Beer</span></h3>
<p>In 1991 Charoen teamed up with the Danish brewer Carlsberg to tap into Thailand's growing beer market, at the time dominated by the 60-year-old Boon Rawd Brewery which made Singha beer. Three years later, based on what he had learned from Carlsberg, he began making his own beer, branded "Chang" (Thai for "elephant"). Within five years, Chang had captured 60 percent of the local market. Completely eclipsed, in 2003 Carlsberg pulled out of the joint venture. Charoen then successfully sued the Danish company, winning US$120 million in 2005.&nbsp;In 2005, an attempt by Siriwattanapakdi to list ThaiBev on the Thai stock market triggered protests from Thai Buddhist groups due to concerns over the dangers of increased consumption of alcohol. The protests from the Buddhists groups managed to stop ThaiBev from being listed on the Thai stock exchange.</p>
<h3><span id="Property" class="mw-headline">Property</span></h3>
<p>Since the early-2000s, Charoen has successfully been able to branch out into property development through the creation of TCC Land Co Ltd. The company is now one of the largest property developers in Thailand, investing in and developing residential, hospitality, and retail sites, as well as engaging in property management, logistics, agro-business, and several property funds in Thailand and Singapore. Since its formal establishment, TCC Land's developments have been primarily focused on Thailand, and indeed the Sirivadhanabhakdi family is now the largest landlord in the country, controlling 630,000 rai of land as of June 2014&mdash;over three times more than Thailand's second largest landowner, and approximately 21 times more than that owned by the royal family's Crown Property Bureau.&nbsp;TCC Land also has several overseas properties that are managed by TCC Land International Co, Ltd, including interests in the US, UK, Australia, Japan, the PRC, and several Southeast Asian countries.</p>
<p>In early 2013, Charoen won a bidding war for Singapore's Fraser and Neave, Ltd which has properties throughout Asia as well as soft-drinks operations, with debt accounting for most of the US$11.2 billion price tag. He received financing to back the deal, the largest merger-and-acquisition transaction introduced in Asia in 2012, from a group of banks including United Overseas Bank, Ltd of Singapore and DBS Bank, Ltd&nbsp;The total number of F&amp;N shares owned by Charoen's group&mdash;TCC Assets and Thai Beverage&mdash;amounts to 1.19 billion, representing an approximate 83 percent stake, as of 14 February.</p>
<h3><span id="Sport" class="mw-headline">Sport</span></h3>
<p>In late-2015 strong rumours emerged that Sirivadhanabhakdi was close to completing a takeover of English Premier League side Everton, a club which Chang Beer has sponsored since 2004.</p>
<h3><span id="Retail" class="mw-headline">Retail</span></h3>
<p>On 7 February 2016 TCC Group announced that it would buy a controlling 58.6 percent stake in Thai hypermarket operator Big C Supercenter for &euro;3.1 billion from Groupe Casino of France. Big C is Thailand's second-largest hypermarket operator after Tesco's Thai unit, and has a market capitalisation of 163.25 billion baht (US$4.6 billion). Charoen's acquisition of Big C would boost the tycoon's retail presence in Thailand. He owns Berli Jucker PCL, the listed retail arm of TCC.</p>
<h2><span id="Family" class="mw-headline">Family</span></h2>
<p>His wife is Khunying Wanna.&nbsp;He has five children.&nbsp;His son, Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi, is now the chief executive officer at ThaiBev and his daughter Wallapa is executive director of TCC Land, the property arm.&nbsp;His youngest son, Panote Sirivadhanabhakdi, is a member of the board executive committee of F&amp;N.</p>

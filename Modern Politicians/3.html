<span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>&nbsp;Hillary Clinton</b></span><br /><br /><br />Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton born October 26, 1947 is an American politician and the Democratic Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2016 election. She served as the 67th United States Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, the junior United States Senator representing New York from 2001 to 2009, First Lady of the United States during the presidency of her husband Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001, and First Lady of Arkansas during his governorship from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992.<br /><br />Born in Chicago and raised in the suburban town of Park Ridge, Illinois, Clinton attended Wellesley College, graduating in 1969, and earned a J.D. from Yale Law School in 1973. After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married Bill Clinton in 1975. In 1977, she co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first woman partner at Rose Law Firm the following year. As First Lady of Arkansas, she led a task force whose recommendations helped reform Arkansas's public schools, and served on several corporate boards.<br /><br />As First Lady of the United States, Clinton led the unsuccessful effort to enact the Clinton health care plan of 1993. In 1997 and 1999, she helped create the State Children's Health Insurance Program. She also tackled the problems of adoption and family safety and foster care. At the 1995 UN conference on women (held in Beijing), Clinton stated in a then controversial and influential speech, that "human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights". Her marriage survived the Lewinsky scandal of 1998, and her role as first lady drew a polarized response from the public.<br /><br />Clinton was elected in 2000 as the first female senator from New York, the only first lady ever to seek elective office. Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, she voted to approve the war in Afghanistan. She also voted for the Iraq Resolution (a vote she later said she regretted). She took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders. She voted against the Bush tax cuts. She voted against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. She was re-elected to the Senate in 2006. Running for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female candidate, but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama.<br /><br />As Secretary of State in the Obama Administration from 2009 to 2013, Clinton responded to the Arab Spring, during which she advocated the U.S. military intervention in Libya. She helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement in 2015. Leaving office after Obama's first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements before announcing her second presidential run in the 2016 election.<br /><br />Clinton received the most votes and primary delegates in the 2016 Democratic primaries, formally accepting her party's nomination for President of the United States on July 28, 2016, with vice presidential running mate Senator Tim Kaine. She became the first female candidate to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party. As part of her 2016 platform, she has emphasized raising incomes, improvements to the Affordable Care Act and reform of campaign finance and Wall Street. She favors allowing pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, expanding and protecting LGBT and women's rights, and instituting family support through paid parental leave and universal preschool.<br /><br /><b>Early life and education</b><br /><br /><br />Hillary&nbsp; Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.&nbsp; She was raised in a United Methodist family, living first in Chicago; when she was three, her family moved to Park Ridge, Illinois. Her father, Hugh Ellsworth Rodham (1911–1993), was of Welsh and English descent;&nbsp; he managed a successful small business in the textile industry. Her mother, Dorothy Emma Howell (1919–2011), was a homemaker of English, Scottish, French-Canadian, Welsh and Dutch descent.&nbsp; Hillary has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony. <br /><br />As a child, Rodham was a favorite of her teachers at the public schools that she attended in Park Ridge.&nbsp; She participated in sports such as swimming and baseball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout.&nbsp; She has often told a story&nbsp; of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be told that no women were being accepted into the program. <br /><br />She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council, the school newspaper, and was selected for the National Honor Society.&nbsp; She won election as class vice president for her junior year, but then lost an election for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her, "you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president."&nbsp; For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School, where she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted "most likely to succeed". She graduated in the top five percent of her class of 1965. Rodham's mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career, and her father, otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. <br /><br />Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age thirteen following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative, and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw, and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.<br />
<br /><b>Wellesley College years</b><br />
<br />In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.&nbsp; During her freshman year, she served as president of the Wellesley Young Republicans;&nbsp; with this Rockefeller Republican-oriented group, she supported the elections of John Lindsay to Mayor of New York City and Massachusetts Attorney General Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.&nbsp; She later stepped down from this position. Clinton would later write in 2003 that her views at this time changed regarding the American Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War. In a letter to her youth minister at this time, she described herself as "a mind conservative and a heart liberal".&nbsp; In contrast to the 1960s current that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it. <br /><br />In her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.&nbsp; In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969.&nbsp; Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty. In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.&nbsp; A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female President of the United States. <br /><br />To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference, and she attended the "Wellesley in Washington" summer program.&nbsp; Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican Representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller's late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination. Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon's campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention's "veiled" racist messages, and left the Republican Party for good.&nbsp; Rodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.&nbsp; (Years later, while she was first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. The thesis was later released. <br /><br />In 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, with departmental honors in political science. After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event, following commencement speaker Senator Brooke.&nbsp; Her speech received a standing ovation lasting seven minutes. She was featured in an article published in Life magazine, due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke.&nbsp; She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.&nbsp; That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions). <br />Yale Law School and postgraduate studies<br /><br />Rodham then entered Yale Law School, where she served on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action. During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center,&nbsp; learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973). She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital&nbsp; and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.&nbsp; In the summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched migrant workers' problems in housing, sanitation, health and education. Edelman later became a significant mentor. Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics. <br /><br />In the late spring of 1971, she began dating Bill Clinton, also a law student at Yale. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein.&nbsp; The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights, civil liberties, and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members);&nbsp; Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.&nbsp; Clinton canceled his original summer plans in order to live with her in California;&nbsp; the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.&nbsp; The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern.&nbsp; She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973, having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton.&nbsp; He first proposed marriage to her following graduation but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his. <br /><br />Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.&nbsp; Her first scholarly article, "Children Under the Law", was published in the Harvard Educational Review in late 1973.&nbsp; Discussing the new children's rights movement, it stated that "child citizens" were "powerless individuals"&nbsp; and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise, on a case-by-case basis. The article became frequently cited in the field. <br />Marriage, family, law career, and First Lady of Arkansas<br />
<br /><b>From the East Coast to Arkansas</b><br /><br />During her postgraduate study, Rodham served as staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts,&nbsp; and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.&nbsp; In 1974 she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., advising the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal. Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum,&nbsp; Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for impeachment.&nbsp; The committee's work culminated in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974. <br /><br />By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright had moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham's career.&nbsp; Wright thought she had the potential to become a future senator or president.&nbsp; Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him and she continued to demur After failing the District of Columbia bar exam&nbsp; and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, "I chose to follow my heart instead of my head".&nbsp; She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. <br />
<br /><b>Early Arkansas years</b><br /><br />At the university, Rodham gave classes in criminal law, where she was considered a rigorous teacher and tough grader.&nbsp; She became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, securing support from the local bar association and gaining federal funding.&nbsp; Among her cases was one where she was obliged by request of the court to serve as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl; she put on an effective defense that led to his pleading guilty to a much lesser charge. Decades later, the victim said that the defense counsel had put her "through hell" during the legal process; Hillary Clinton has called the trial a "terrible case".&nbsp; During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city's first rape crisis center.&nbsp; Rodham still harbored doubts about marriage, concerned that her separate identity would be lost and her accomplishments viewed in the light of someone else's. <br /><br />Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975, and she finally agreed to marry him.&nbsp; Their wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room. A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she was retaining the name Hillary Rodham. The motivation was to keep the couple's professional lives separate and avoid apparent conflicts of interest and because, as she told a friend at the time, "it showed that I was still me."&nbsp; The decision did upset both their mothers.&nbsp; Clinton had lost the congressional race in 1974, but in November 1976 was elected Arkansas Attorney General, and so the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.&nbsp; There, in February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence. She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law while also working pro bono in child advocacy; she rarely performed litigation work in court. <br /><br />Clinton maintained her interest in children's law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles "Children's Policies: Abandonment and Neglect" in 1977&nbsp; and "Children's Rights: A Legal Perspective" in 1979. The latter continued her argument that children's legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted.&nbsp; An American Bar Association chair later said, "Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate."&nbsp; Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as "one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades",&nbsp; while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority,&nbsp; would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents,&nbsp; and exemplified legal "crit" theory run amok. <br /><br />In 1977, Clinton cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children's Defense Fund.&nbsp; Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana)&nbsp; appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation,&nbsp; and she served in that capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981.&nbsp; From mid-1978 to mid-1980, she was the chair of that board, the first woman to have the job.&nbsp; During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90 million to $300 million; subsequently she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan's attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization. <br /><br />Following her husband's November 1978 election as Governor of Arkansas, Clinton became First Lady of Arkansas in January 1979, a title that she held for twelve years (1979–81, 1983–92). Clinton appointed her chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,&nbsp; where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas's poorest areas without affecting doctors' fees. <br /><br />In 1979, Clinton became the first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm.&nbsp; From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.&nbsp; During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Clinton engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts; an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months. The couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal at this time.&nbsp; Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.<br /><br />On February 27, 1980, Clinton gave birth to a daughter, Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election. <br />
<br /><b>Later Arkansas years</b><br /><br />Bill Clinton returned to the governor's office two years later after winning the election of 1982. During her husband's campaign, Hillary began to use the name "Hillary Clinton", or sometimes "Mrs. Bill Clinton", to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time.&nbsp; As First Lady of Arkansas again, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name.&nbsp; She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state's court-sanctioned public education system. In one of the Clinton governorship's most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size.&nbsp; It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort.&nbsp; In 1985, she introduced Arkansas's Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy.&nbsp; She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.<br /><br />Clinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was First Lady of Arkansas. She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours,&nbsp; but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there.&nbsp; The firm considered her a "rainmaker" because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.&nbsp; Bill Clinton's Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest, because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated. <br /><br />From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation,&nbsp; which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.&nbsp; From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it. She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America: in 1988 and in 1991. When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running, but private polls were unfavorable and, in the end, he ran and was re-elected for the final time. <br /><br />Clinton served on the boards of the Arkansas Children's Hospital Legal Services (1988–92)&nbsp; and the Children's Defense Fund (as chair, 1986–92). In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985–92), Wal-Mart Stores (1986–92)&nbsp; and Lafarge (1990–92).&nbsp; TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.&nbsp; Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart's board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.&nbsp; Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, was largely unsuccessful in a campaign for more women to be added to the company's management, and was silent about the company's famously anti-labor union practices. <br />
<br /><b>Bill Clinton presidential campaign of 1992</b><br /><br />Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.&nbsp; In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged "causing pain in my marriage".&nbsp; This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.&nbsp; During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song "Stand by Your Man", and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead&nbsp; The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers, and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would "get two for the price of one", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume. Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article "The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives. At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth. <br />
<br /><b>First Lady of the United States</b><br />
<br /><b>Role as first lady</b><br /><br />When Bill Clinton took office as President in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady, and her press secretary reiterated that she would be using that form of her name.&nbsp; She was the inaugural First Lady to have earned a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House. She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.&nbsp; She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.&nbsp; After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history. <br /><br />Some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton's role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husband's presidency.&nbsp; Bill Clinton's campaign promise of "two for the price of one" led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as "co-presidents" or sometimes use the Arkansas label "Billary".&nbsp; The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into "imaginary discussions" with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt. From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures. Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy, and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner's "politics of meaning" to overcome what she saw as America's "sleeping sickness of the soul"; that would lead to a willingness "to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium." <br />
<br /><b>Health care and other policy initiatives<br />&nbsp;</b><br /><br />In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a Task Force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform.&nbsp; Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority. The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan, a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as "Hillarycare", and it faced opposition from even some Democrats in Congress.&nbsp; Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic, and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times. <br /><br />Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.&nbsp; Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat, but cited many other factors. The First Lady's approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first year, fell to 44 percent in April 1994 and 35 percent by September 1994. <br /><br />Republicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections. Republicans saw a net gain of fifty-three seats in the House election and seven in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats' defeat, especially among independent voters.&nbsp; The White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton's role in shaping policy.&nbsp; Opponents of universal health care would continue to use "Hillarycare" as a pejorative label for similar plans by others. <br /><br />Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of the State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal effort that provided state support for children whose parents could not provide them with health coverage, and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law.&nbsp; She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood illnesses and encouraged older women to seek a mammogram to detect breast cancer, with coverage provided by Medicare.&nbsp; She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health.&nbsp; The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome. <br /><br />Enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton's presidency, but when the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress that lacked protections for people coming off welfare, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did.&nbsp; A third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again. But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available.&nbsp; This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called "sad and painful".<br /><br />Together with Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice.&nbsp; In 1997, she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as first lady.&nbsp; In 1999, she was instrumental in the passage of the Foster Care Independence Act, which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care . As first lady, Clinton hosted numerous White House conferences, including ones on Child Care (1997),&nbsp; on Early Childhood Development and Learning (1997),&nbsp; and on Children and Adolescents (2000).&nbsp; She also hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Teenagers (2000) and the first-ever White House Conference on Philanthropy (1999). <br /><br />Clinton traveled to 79 countries during this time,&nbsp; breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon.&nbsp; She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives.&nbsp; A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan. Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps.&nbsp; The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy. <br /><br />In a September 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued very forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the People's Republic of China itself, declaring that "it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights". Delegates from over 180 countries heard her say: "If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all."&nbsp; In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.&nbsp; The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton's key phrases. She was one of the most prominent international figures during the late 1990s to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban. She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to promote the participation of women in the political processes of their countries.&nbsp; It and Clinton's own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the Northern Ireland peace process. <br /><br /><b>Email controversy<br />&nbsp;</b><br /><br />A controversy arose in March 2015, when it was revealed by the State Department's inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server—instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress, and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi. <br />In a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection, and "never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system."&nbsp; They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems.&nbsp; Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house.&nbsp; Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.&nbsp; After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called "born classified" category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server. The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department. Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails "contained classified State Department information when originated."&nbsp; In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked. <br />Clinton maintained that she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, "I never sent or received any classified material – they are retroactively classifying it." On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: "Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified." <br />On July 5, 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director James Comey said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were "up-classified" to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent. <br /><br />Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were only marked with a small "c" in parentheses, described as "portion markings" by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not "technically sophisticated" enough to understand what the three classified markings meant. The probe found that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI assessed that it "is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account."&nbsp; Comey stated that although Clinton or her colleagues were "extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information", the FBI would recommend to the Justice Department that "no charges are appropriate in this case." On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch confirmed that the probe into Clinton's use of private email servers while secretary of state will be closed without criminal charges. <br /><br /><b>&nbsp;Political positions</b><br />
<br />Several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton's place on the political spectrum scientifically using her Senate votes. National Journal's 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 in the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.&nbsp; National Journal's subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007. A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her to be likely the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator. The Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, in three areas: Economic, Social, and Foreign. Averaged for the four years, the ratings are: Economic = 75 liberal, 23 conservative; Social = 83 liberal, 6 conservative; Foreign = 66 liberal, 30 conservative. Total average = 75 liberal, 20 conservative.&nbsp; According to FiveThirtyEight's measure of political ideology, "Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate." <br /><br />Organizations have also attempted to give newer assessments of Clinton once she reentered elective politics in 2015. Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues places her in their "Left Liberal" region on their two-dimensional grid of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances and an economic score of 10 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances.&nbsp; Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes, and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative). Through 2008, she had an average lifetime 90 percent "Liberal Quotient" from Americans for Democratic Action,&nbsp; and a lifetime 8 percent rating from the American Conservative Union. <br /><br />In March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called "optimistic" and "wide-ranging".&nbsp; Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a "clawback" that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an "exit tax" on companies that move their headquarters out of America in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas.&nbsp; Clinton 'opposes' (though previously supported) the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and holds that "any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security".&nbsp; As Senator (2001-2009), her record on trade was mixed, voting in favor of some trade agreements but not others. <br /><br />Given the climate of unlimited campaign contributions following the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to limit "unaccountable money" in politics. In July 2016, she "committed" to introducing a U.S. constitutional amendment that would result in overturning the 2010 Citizens United decision.&nbsp; On December 7, 2015, in The New York Times, Clinton presented her detailed plans for regulating Wall Street financial activities. <br /><br />Clinton accepted the scientific consensus on climate change, supports cap-and-trade,&nbsp; and opposed the Keystone XL pipeline. <br /><br />She supported equal pay for equal work, to address current shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do.&nbsp; Clinton has explicitly focused on family issues and supports universal preschool.&nbsp; These programs would be funded by proposing tax increases on the wealthy, including a “fair share surcharge".<br /><br />Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act and would have added a "public option" that would have competed against private insurers and enabled people "50 or 55 and up" to buy into Medicare. <br /><br />On LGBT rights, she supported the right to same-sex marriage. Clinton first expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage in 2013; in 2000, she had been against such unions altogether, and in 2006, she said only that she would support a state's decision to permit same-sex marriages.&nbsp; In 2000, she was the first First Lady to march in an LGBT pride parade.&nbsp; In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper (Philadelphia Gay News). <br /><br />Clinton held that allowing undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship is at its heart a family issue," and expressed support for Obama's Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would allow up to five million undocumented immigrants to gain deferral of deportation and authorization to legally work in the United States.&nbsp; She opposed and criticized Trump's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.<br /><br />Clinton expressed support for Common Core.&nbsp; She said, "The really unfortunate argument that's been going on around Common Core, it's very painful because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort. It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn't politicized.... Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And&nbsp; you see the value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven't had that, and so don't understand the value of a core, in this sense a Common Core." <br /><br />On foreign affairs, Clinton voted in October 2002 in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, a vote she later 'regretted'. She favored arming Syria's rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.&nbsp; She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.&nbsp; Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East.&nbsp; She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, "America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security and survival."&nbsp; Clinton expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. <br /><br />In 2000, Clinton advocated for eliminating the electoral college and promised to co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it resulting in the direct election of the president.<br />
<br />
<b>Religious views</b><br /><br />Clinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending various churches throughout her lifetime; all belonging to the United Methodist Church:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First United Methodist Church of Park Ridge, Illinois—in her early life,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First United Methodist Church of Little Rock, Arkansas—while in Arkansas,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C.—as First Lady of the United States,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metropolitan Community United Methodist Church in New York City, New York—currently a congregant.<br /><br />She discussed her faith at 2014 United Methodist Women church rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky.&nbsp; However, she has infrequently discussed her faith while campaigning. As of 2016, Clinton has openly discussed her Christianity on several occasions, discussing for example the importance of loving one's neighbor as oneself, of helping the poor and "creating opportunities for others to be lifted up".&nbsp; Clinton has also expressed disappointment that "Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly." <br /><br />Professor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, has suggested that Clinton's political positions are rooted in her faith. Clinton often expresses a certain maxim which is often attributed to John Wesley: "Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can." In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy "made sure I learned these words from our Methodist faith." <br />
<br /><b>Writings and recordings</b><br /><br />As First Lady of the United States, Clinton published a weekly syndicated newspaper column titled "Talking It Over" from 1995 to 2000.&nbsp; It focused on her experiences and those of women, children, and families she met during her travels around the world. <br /><br />In 1996, Clinton presented a vision for the children of America in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us. The book made the Best Seller list of The New York Times and Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book's audio recording.&nbsp; She was the first First Lady to win a Grammy Award. <br /><br />Other books published by Clinton when she was first lady include Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword to the children's book Beatrice's Goat. <br /><br />In 2003, Clinton released a 562-page autobiography, Living History, for which publisher Simon &amp; Schuster paid Clinton a near-record advance of $8 million.&nbsp; The book set a first-week sales record for a nonfiction work,&nbsp; went on to sell more than one million copies in the first month following publication, and was translated into twelve foreign languages. Clinton's audio recording of the book earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. <br /><br />In 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as Secretary of State. As of July 2015, the book has sold about 280,000 copies. <br /><br />In 2016, Clinton, along with her running mate Tim Kaine, published Stronger Together, outlining her vision for the United States if she is elected President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election.<br />
<br /><b>Cultural and political image</b><br /><br />Over a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton, from many perspectives. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found "a virtual cottage industry" of "anti-Clinton literature",&nbsp; put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints,&nbsp; with titles such as Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House, and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless ... Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well (other than the memoirs written by her and her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her.&nbsp; Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable "bogeyman" to mention in fundraising letters,&nbsp; on a par with Ted Kennedy, and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich. <br /><br />Clinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture from a wide spectrum of varying perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test, an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, "Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society." She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as first lady, and has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelgängers. <br /><br />Clinton has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, with some arguing otherwise.&nbsp; James Madison University political science professor Valerie Sulfaro's 2007 study used the American National Election Studies' "feeling thermometer" polls, which measure the degree of opinion about a political figure, to find that such polls during Clinton's first lady years confirm the "conventional wisdom that Hillary Clinton is a polarizing figure", with the added insight that "affect towards Mrs. Clinton as first lady tended to be very positive or very negative, with a fairly constant one fourth of respondents feeling ambivalent or neutral".&nbsp; University of California, San Diego political science professor Gary Jacobson's 2006 study of partisan polarization found that in a state-by-state survey of job approval ratings of the state's senators, Clinton had the fourth-largest partisan difference of any senator, with a 50-percentage-point difference in approval between New York's<br />
<br />
<b>Democrats and Republicans. </b><br /><br />Northern Illinois University political science professor Barbara Burrell's 2000 study found that Clinton's Gallup poll favorability numbers broke sharply along partisan lines throughout her time as first lady, with 70 to 90 percent of Democrats typically viewing her favorably while only 20 to 40 percent of Republicans did.&nbsp; University of Wisconsin–Madison political science professor Charles Franklin analyzed her record of favorable versus unfavorable ratings in public opinion polls, and found that there was more variation in them during her first lady years than her Senate years. The Senate years showed favorable ratings around 50 percent and unfavorable ratings in the mid-40 percent range; Franklin noted that, "This sharp split is, of course, one of the more widely remarked aspects of Sen. Clinton's public image."&nbsp; McGill University professor of history Gil Troy titled his 2006 biography of her Hillary Rodham Clinton: Polarizing First Lady, and wrote that after the 1992 campaign, Clinton "was a polarizing figure, with 42 percent of the public saying she came closer to their values and lifestyle than previous first ladies and 41 percent disagreeing."&nbsp; Troy further wrote that Clinton "has been uniquely controversial and contradictory since she first appeared on the national radar screen in 1992"&nbsp; and that she "has alternately fascinated, bedeviled, bewitched, and appalled Americans." <br /><br />Burrell's study found women consistently rating Clinton more favorably than men by about ten percentage points during her first lady years.&nbsp; Jacobson's study found a positive correlation across all senators between being women and receiving a partisan-polarized response. Colorado State University communication studies professor Karrin Vasby Anderson describes the first lady position as a "site" for American womanhood, one ready made for the symbolic negotiation of female identity.&nbsp; In particular, Anderson states there has been a cultural bias towards traditional first ladies and a cultural prohibition against modern first ladies; by the time of Clinton, the first lady position had become a site of heterogeneity and paradox.&nbsp; Burrell, as well as biographers Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr., note that Clinton achieved her highest approval ratings as first lady late in 1998, not for professional or political achievements of her own, but for being seen as the victim of her husband's very public infidelity.&nbsp; University of Pennsylvania communications professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson saw Clinton as an exemplar of the double bind, who though able to live in a "both-and" world of both career and family, nevertheless "became a surrogate on whom we projected our attitudes about attributes once thought incompatible", leading to her being placed in a variety of no-win situations.&nbsp; Quinnipiac University media studies professor Lisa Burns found press accounts frequently framing Clinton both as an exemplar of the modern professional working mother and as a political interloper interested in usurping power for herself.&nbsp; University of Indianapolis English professor Charlotte Templin found political cartoonists using a variety of stereotypes—such as gender reversal, radical feminist as emasculator, and the wife the husband wants to get rid of—to portray Clinton as violating gender norms. <br /><br />Going into the early stages of her presidential campaign for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled "Love Her", "Hate Her",&nbsp; while Mother Jones titled its profile of her "Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary". Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls of their desired candidates,&nbsp; while some conservative figures such as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary Clinton presidency not so bad after all. An October 2007 cover of The American Conservative magazine was titled "The Waning Power of Hillary Hate".&nbsp; By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed that there was a large amount of misogyny present about Clinton on the Internet, up to and including Facebook and other sites devoted to depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation. She noted, in response to widespread comments on Clinton's laugh,&nbsp; that "We know that there's language to condemn female speech that doesn't exist for male speech. We call women's speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton's laugh was being described as a cackle."&nbsp; The "bitch" epithet, which had been applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American politics,&nbsp; flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet but via conventional media as well&nbsp; Following Clinton's "choked up moment" and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.&nbsp; Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events "brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades ... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics." <br /><br />Once she became Secretary of State, Clinton's image seemed to improve dramatically among the American public and become one of a respected world figure.&nbsp; She gained consistently high approval ratings (by 2011, the highest of her career except during the Lewinsky scandal), and her favorable-unfavorable ratings during 2010 and 2011 were the highest of any active, nationally prominent American political figure.&nbsp; A 2012 Internet meme, "Texts from Hillary", was based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics. Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'"&nbsp; She continued to do well in Gallup's most admired man and woman poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall. <br /><br />Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics again.&nbsp; By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever. During 2016 she acknowledged that: "I'm not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed."&nbsp; Journalist Indira A. R. Lakshmanan, who has covered Clinton extensively both as a presidential candidate and as secretary of state, believes that Clinton's persona is almost completely different in the two roles and that while Clinton definitely has the political skills that an officeholder needs, "Clearly, however, something seems to happen to Clinton when the task is asking people to vote for her." <br />
<br /><b>2016 presidential campaign</b><br /><br />On April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election.&nbsp; She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives, and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees, and other infrastructure.&nbsp; The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.&nbsp; Focuses of her campaign have included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable, and improving the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp; Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,&nbsp; Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from self-professed democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties. <br /><br />In the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders,&nbsp; making her the first woman to win the Iowa caucuses. In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin.&nbsp; Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20,&nbsp; but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers. Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27. These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort. <br /><br />On March 1 ("Super Tuesday"), Clinton won seven of eleven contests, including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters, and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders. She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural, and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while Clinton did better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats. <br /><br />By June 5, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee.&nbsp; On June 7, after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn in which she became the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party. By campaign's end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders' 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders' 47. She received almost 17 million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders' 13 million. <br /><br />Clinton was formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 26, 2016, becoming the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.&nbsp; Her choice of vice presidential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, was nominated by the Convention the following day.&nbsp; Her opponents in the general election are Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson, and Jill Stein of the Green Party.<br /><br />Clinton has held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton became tied in major polls following the FBI's conclusion of its investigation into her emails.&nbsp; FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been "extremely careless" in her handling of classified government material. In late July, Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in major polls following a 3 to 4 percentage point convention bounce at the Republican National Convention, right in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it is toward the small side by historical standards.&nbsp; Following Clinton's 7 percentage point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention, she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August.<br />
<br /><b>Clinton Foundation and speeches</b><br />
<br />When Clinton left the State Department, she became a private citizen for the first time in thirty years.&nbsp; She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013. There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600 million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. <br /><br />Clinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995;&nbsp; its March 2015 report said that while "There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman ... this data shows just how far we still have to go." The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary. However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments. <br /><br />She began work on another volume of memoirs, and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit. There she received $200,000–225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions.&nbsp; She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation.&nbsp; For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11 million from her speeches. For the overall period 2007–14, the Clintons earned almost $141 million, paid some $56 million in federal and state taxes, and donated about $15 million to charity. As of 2015, she was estimated to be worth over $30 million on her own, or $45–53 million with her husband. <br /><br />Clinton resigned from the foundation's board in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign, and the foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six Western nations only. <br /><br /></div>

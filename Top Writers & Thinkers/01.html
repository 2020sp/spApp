<b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Munshi Premchand</span></b><br /><br />Premchand 31 
July 1880 – 8 October 1936, better known as Munshi Premchand, Munshi 
being an honorary prefix, was an Indian writer famous for his modern 
Hindi-Urdu literature. He is one of the most celebrated writers of the 
Indian subcontinent,&nbsp; and is regarded as one of the foremost Hindustani 
writers of the early twentieth century. Born Dhanpat Rai Srivastav, he 
began writing under the pen name "Nawab Rai", but subsequently switched 
to "Premchand". A novel writer, story writer and dramatist, he has been 
referred to as the "Upanyas Samrat" ("Emperor among Novelists") by 
writers. His works include more than a dozen novels, around 250 short 
stories, several essays and translations of a number of foreign literary
 works into Hindi.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">Biography</span><br />Early life</span><br />Premchand
 was born on 31 July 1880 in Lamhi, a village located near Varanasi 
(Banaras). His ancestors came from a large Kayastha family, which owned 
six bighas of land&nbsp; His grandfather Guru Sahai Rai was a patwari 
(village land record-keeper), and his father Ajaib Rai was a post office
 clerk. His mother was Anandi Devi of Karauni village, who could have 
been the inspiration for the character Anandi in his Bade Ghar Ki Beti. 
Premchand was the fourth child of Ajaib Lal and Anandi; the first two 
were girls who died as infants, and the third one was a girl named 
Suggi.&nbsp; His parents named him Dhanpat Rai ("the master of wealth"), 
while his uncle, Mahabir, a rich landowner, nicknamed him "Nawab" 
("Prince"). "Nawab Rai" was the first pen name chosen by Premchand. <br /><br />When
 he was 7 years old, Premchand began his education at a madrasa in 
Lalpur, located near Lamahi.&nbsp; He learnt Urdu and Persian from a maulvi 
in the madrasa. When he was 8, his mother died after a long illness. His
 grandmother, who took the responsibility of raising him, died soon 
after.&nbsp; Premchand felt isolated, as his elder sister had already been 
married, and his father was always busy with work. His father, who was 
now posted at Gorkhapur, remarried, but Premchand received little 
affection from his step-mother. The step-mother later became a recurring
 theme in Premchand's works. <br /><br />As a child, Premchand sought solace
 in fiction, and developed a fascination for books. He heard the stories
 from the Persian-language fantasy epic Tilism-e-Hoshruba at a 
tobacconist's shop. He took the job of selling books for a book 
wholesaler, thus getting the opportunity to read a lot of books.&nbsp; He 
learnt English at a missionary school, and studied several works of 
fiction including George W. M. Reynolds's eight-volume The Mysteries of 
the Court of London.&nbsp; He composed his first literary work at Gorakhpur, 
which was never published and is now lost. It was a farce on a bachelor,
 who falls in love with a low-caste woman. The character was based on 
Premchand's uncle, who used to scold him for being obsessed with reading
 fiction; the farce was probably written as a revenge for this. <br /><br />After
 his father was posted to Jamniya in the mid-1890s, Premchand enrolled 
at the Queen's College at Banaras as a day scholar.&nbsp; In 1895, he was 
married at the age of 15, while still studying in the 9th grade. The 
match was arranged by his maternal step-grandfather. The girl was from a
 rich landlord family and was older than Premchand, who found her 
quarrelsome and not good-looking. <br /><br />Premchand's father died in 
1897 after a long illness. He managed to pass the matriculation exam 
with second division(below 60% marks). However, only the students with 
first division were given fee concession at the Queen's College. 
Premchand then sought admission at the Central Hindu College, but was 
unsuccessful because of his poor arithmetic skills. Thus, he had to 
discontinue his studies.<br /><br />Premchand then obtained an assignment to
 coach an advocate's son in Benares at a monthly salary of five rupees. 
He used to reside in a mud-cell over the advocate's stables, and used to
 send 60% of his salary back home.&nbsp; Premchand read a lot during these 
days. After racking up several debts, in 1899, he once went to a book 
shop to sell one of his collected books. There, he met the headmaster of
 a missionary school at Chunar, who offered him a job as a teacher, at a
 monthly salary of ₹ 18.&nbsp; He also took up the job of tutoring a student 
at a monthly fees of ₹ 5.<br /><br />In 1900, Premchand secured a job as an 
assistant teacher at the Government District School, Bahraich, at a 
monthly salary of ₹ 20. Three months later, he was transferred to the 
District School in Pratapgarh, where he stayed in an administrator's 
bungalow and tutored his son. <br /><br />Dhanpat Rai first wrote under the 
pseudonym "Nawab Rai". His first short novel was Asrar e Ma'abid 
(Devasthan Rahasya in Hindi, "The Secrets of God's Abode"), which 
explores corruption among the temple priests and their sexual 
exploitation of poor women. The novel was published in a series in the 
Benares-based Urdu weekly Awaz-e-Khalk from 8 October 1903 to February 
1905.&nbsp; Literary critic Siegfried Schulz states that "his inexperience is
 quite evident in his first novel", which is not well-organized, lacks a
 good plot and features stereotyped characters.&nbsp; Prakash Chandra Gupta 
calls it an "immature work", which shows a tendency to "see life only 
white or black". <br /><b>Stay at Kanpur</b><br /><br />From Pratapgarh, 
Dhanpat Rai was relocated to Allahabad for training, and subsequently 
posted at Kanpur in 1905. Premchand stayed in Kanpur for around four 
years, from May 1905 to June 1909. There he met Daya Narain Nigam, the 
editor of the magazine Zamana, in which he later published several 
articles and stories.<br /><br />Premchand visited his village Lamahi during
 the summer vacation, but did not find the stay enjoyable because of a 
number of reasons. He did not find the weather of the atmosphere 
conducive for writing. Plus, he faced domestic trouble due to quarrels 
between his wife and his step-mother. Premchand angrily scolded his 
wife, after she unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide by hanging. 
Dismayed, she went to her father's house, and Premchand displayed no 
interest in bringing her back.&nbsp; In 1906, Premchand married a child 
widow, Shivarani Devi, who was the daughter of a landlord from a village
 near Fatehpur.&nbsp; The step was considered to be revolutionary at that 
time, and Premchand faced a lot of social opposition. After his death, 
Shivarani Devi wrote a book on him, titled Premchand Ghar Mein 
("Premchand in House").<br /><br />In 1905, inspired by the nationalist 
activism, Premchand published an article on the Indian National Congress
 leader Gopal Krishna Gokhale in Zamana. He criticised Gokhale's methods
 for achieving political freedom, and instead recommended adoption of 
more extremist measures adopted by Bal Gangadhar Tilak.&nbsp; Premchand's 
first published story was Duniya Ka Sabse Anmol Ratan ("The Most 
Precious Jewel in the World"), which appeared in Zamana in 1907.&nbsp; 
According to this story, the most precious 'jewel' was the last drop of 
blood necessary to attain independence.&nbsp; Many of Premchand's early short
 stories had patriotic overtones, influenced by the Indian independence 
movement. <br /><br />Premchand's second short novel Hamkhurma-o-Hamsavab 
(Prema in Hindi), published in 1907, was penned under the name "Babu 
Nawab Rai Banarsi". It explores the issue of widow remarriage in the 
contemporary conservative society: the protagonist Amrit Rai overcomes 
social opposition to marry the young widow Poorna, giving up his rich 
and beautiful fiance Prema. According to Prakash Chandra Gupta, "while 
containing seeds of his future greatness in many ways, the novel is 
still youthful and lacks the discipline which full maturity brings". <br /><br />In
 1907, another of Premchand's short novels, Kishna was published by the 
Medical Hall Press of Benares. This 142-page work, which satirises 
women's fondness for jewellery, is now lost.&nbsp; Literary critic Nobat Rai 
criticised the work in Zamana, calling it a mockery of the women's 
conditions. <br /><br />During April–August 1907, Premchand's story Roothi 
Rani was published in serial form in Zamana.&nbsp; Also in 1907, the 
publishers of Zamana published Premchand's first short story collection,
 titled Soz-e-Watan. The collection, which was later banned, contained 
four stories which sought to inspire the Indians in their struggle for 
political freedom.<br />
<b>Adoption of the name Premchand</b><br /><br />In
 1909, Premchand was transferred to Mahoba, and later posted to Hamirpur
 as the Sub-deputy Inspector of Schools. Around this time, Soz-e-Watan 
was noticed by the British Government officials, who banned it as a 
seditious work. The British collector of the Hamirpur District ordered a
 raid on Premchand's house, where around five hundred copies of 
Soz-e-Watan were burnt. Subsequently, Dhanpat Rai had to change his 
pseudonym from "Nawab Rai" to "Premchand".<br /><br />In 1914, Premchand 
started writing in Hindi (Hindi and Urdu are considered different 
registers of a single language Hindustani, with Hindi drawing much of 
its vocabulary from Sanskrit and Urdu being more influenced by Persian).
 By this time, he was already reputed as a fiction writer in Urdu.&nbsp; 
Sumit Sarkar notes that the switch was prompted by the difficulty of 
finding publishers in Urdu.&nbsp; His first Hindi story Saut was published in
 the magazine Saraswati in December 1915, and his first short story 
collection Sapta Saroj was published in June 1917.<br />
<br /><b>Gorakhpur</b><br /><br />In
 August 1916, Premchand was transferred to Gorakhpur on a promotion. He 
became the Assistant Master at the Normal High School, Gorakhpur. <br /><br />At
 Gorakhpur, he developed a friendship with the bookseller Buddhi Lal, 
who allowed him to borrow novels for reading, in exchange for selling 
exam cram books at the school.&nbsp; Premchand was an enthusiastic reader of 
classics in other languages, and translated several of these works in 
Hindi.<br /><br />By 1919, Premchand had published four novels, of about a 
hundred pages each. In 1919, Premchand's first major novel Seva Sadan 
was published in Hindi. The novel was originally written in Urdu under 
the title Bazaar-e-Husn, but was published in Hindi first by a 
Calcutta-based publisher, who offered Premchand ₹ 450 for his work. The 
Urdu Publisher of Lahore published the novel later in 1924, paying 
Premchand ₹ 250. The novel tells the story of an unhappy housewife, who 
first becomes a courtesan, and then manages an orphanage for the young 
daughters of the courtesans. It was well received by the critics, and 
helped Premchand gain wider recognition.<br /><br />In 1919, Premchand 
obtained a BA degree from Allahabad.&nbsp; By 1921, he had been promoted to 
Deputy Inspectors of Schools. On 8 February 1921, he attended a meeting 
in Gorakhpur, where Mahatma Gandhi asked people to resign from 
government jobs as part of the non-cooperation movement. Premchand, 
although physically unwell and with two kids and a pregnant wife to 
support, thought about it for 5 days and decided, with the consent of 
his wife, to resign from his government job.<b><br />Back to Banaras</b><br /><br />After
 quitting his job, Premchand left Gorakhpur for Banaras on 18 March 
1921, and decided to focus on his literary career . Till his death in 
1936, he faced severe financial difficulties and chronic ill health. <br /><br />In
 1923, he established a printing press and publishing house in Benares, 
christened "Saraswati Press". The year 1924 saw the publication of 
Premchand's Rangabhumi, which has a blind beggar called Surdas as its 
tragic hero. Schulz mentions that in Rangabhumi, Premchand comes across 
as a "superb social chronicler", and although the novel contains some 
"structural flaws" and "too many authorial explanations", it shows a 
"marked progress" in Premchand's writing style.&nbsp; According to Schulz, it
 was in Nirmala (1925) and Pratigya (1927) that Premchand found his way 
to "a balanced, realistic level" that surpasses his earlier works and 
manages to "hold his readers in tutelage".&nbsp; Nirmala, a novel dealing 
with the dowry system in India, was first serialised in the magazine 
Chand between November 1925 and November 1926, before being published as
 a novel.&nbsp; Pratigya ("The Vow") dealt with the subject of widow 
remarriage.<br /><br />In 1928, Premchand's novel Gaban ("Embezzlement"), 
focusing on the middle class' greed, was published. In March 1930, 
Premchand launched a literary-political weekly magazine titled Hans, 
aimed at inspiring the Indians to mobilise against the British rule.&nbsp; 
The magazine, noted for its politically provocative views, failed to 
make a profit. Premchand then took over and edited another magazine 
called Jagaran, which too ran at a loss. <br /><br />In 1931, Premchand 
moved to Kanpur as a teacher in the Marwari College, but had to leave 
because of difference with the college administration. He then returned 
to Benares, and became the editor of the Maryada magazine. In 1932, he 
published another novel titled Karmabhumi. He briefly served as the 
headmaster of the Kashi Vidyapeeth, a local school. After the school's 
closure, he became the editor of the Madhuri magazine in Lucknow. <br />
<br /><b>Mumbai</b><br /><br />Premchand
 arrived in Mumbai on 31 May 1934 to try his luck in the Hindi film 
industry. He had accepted a script writing job for the production house 
Ajanta Cinetone, hoping that the yearly salary of ₹ 8000 would help him 
overcome his financial troubles. He stayed in Dadar, and wrote the 
script for the film Mazdoor ("The Labourer"). The film, directed by 
Mohan Bhawnani, depicted the poor conditions on the labour class. 
Premchand himself did a cameo as the leader of labourers in the film. 
Some influential businessmen managed to get a stay on its release in 
Mumbai. The film was released in Lahore and Delhi, but was banned again 
after it inspired the mill workers to stand up against the owners. <br /><br />Ironically,
 the film inspired the workers of his own loss-making press in Benares 
to launch a strike, after they were not paid their salaries.&nbsp; By 
1934–35, Premchand's Saraswati Press was under a heavy debt of ₹ 4000, 
and Premchand was forced to discontinue the publication of Jagaran. 
Meanwhile, Premchand was beginning to dislike the non-literary 
commercial environment of the Mumbai film industry, and wanted to return
 to Benares. However, he had signed a one-year contract with the 
production house. He ultimately left Mumbai on 4 April 1935, before the 
completion of one year.&nbsp; Himanshu Roy, the founder of Bombay Talkies, 
tried to convince Premchand to stay back, but did not succeed.<br />
<br /><b>Last days</b><br /><br />After
 leaving Bombay, Premchand wanted to settle in Allahabad, where his sons
 Sripat Rai and Amrit Rai were studying. He also planned to publish Hans
 from there. However, owing to his financial situation and ill-health, 
he had to hand over Hans to the Indian Literary Counsel and move to 
Benares. <br /><br />Premchand was elected as the first President of the 
Progressive Writers' Association in Lucknow, in 1936.&nbsp; He died on 8 
October 1936, after several days of sickness.<br /><br />Godaan (The Gift of
 a Cow, 1936), Premchand's last completed work, is generally accepted as
 his best novel, and is considered as one of the finest Hindi novels.&nbsp; 
The protagonist, Hori, a poor peasant, desperately longs for a cow, a 
symbol of wealth and prestige in rural India. According to Schulz, 
"Godan is a well-structured and well-balanced novel which amply fulfills
 the literary requirements postulated by the Western literary 
standards."Unlike other contemporary renowned authors such as 
Rabindranath Tagore, Premchand was not appreciated much outside India. 
Siegfried Schulz believes that the reason for this was absence of good 
translations of his work. Also, unlike Tagore and Iqbal, Premchand never
 travelled outside India, studied abroad or mingled with the renowned 
foreign literary figures.<br /><br />In 1936, Premchand also published Kafan
 ("Shroud"), in which a poor man collects money for the funeral rites of
 his dead wife, but spends it on food and drink. Premchand's last 
published story was Cricket Match, which appeared in Zamana in 1938 , 
after his death. <br />
<br /><b>Style and influences</b><br>Premchand is 
considered the first Hindi author whose writings prominently featured 
realism. His novels describe the problems of the poor and the urban 
middle-class.&nbsp; His works depict a rationalistic outlook, which views 
religious values as something that allows the powerful hypocrites to 
exploit the weak. He used literature for the purpose of arousing public 
awareness about national and social issues and often wrote about topics 
related to corruption, child widowhood, prostitution, feudal system, 
poverty, colonialism and on the India's freedom movement. <br /><br />Premchand
 started taking an interest in political affairs while at Kanpur during 
the late 1900s, and this is reflected in his early works, which have 
patriotic overtones. His political thoughts were initially influenced by
 the moderate Indian National Congress leader Gopal Krishna Gokhale, but
 later, he moved towards the more extremist Bal Gangadhar Tilak.&nbsp; He 
considered the Minto-Morley Reforms and the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms 
as inadequate, and supported greater political freedom.&nbsp; Several of his 
early works, such as A Little Trick and A Moral Victory, satirised the 
Indians who cooperated with the British Government. He did not 
specifically mention the British in some of his stories, because of 
strong government censorship, but disguised his opposition in settings 
from the medieval era and the foreign history. He was also influenced by
 the teachings of Swami Vivekananda. <br /><br />In the 1920s, he was 
influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's non-co-operation movement and the 
accompanying struggle for social reform. During this period, his works 
dealt with the social issues such as poverty, zamindari exploitation 
(Premashram, 1922), dowry system (Nirmala, 1925), educational reform and
 political oppression (Karmabhumi, 1931).&nbsp; Premchand was focused on the 
economic liberalisation of the peasantry and the working class, and was 
opposed to the rapid industrialisation, which he felt would hurt the 
interests of the peasants and lead to oppression of the workers.&nbsp; This 
can be seen in works like Rangabhumi (1924).<br /><br />In his last days, he
 focused on village life as a stage for complex drama, as seen in the 
novel Godan (1936) and the short-story collection Kafan (1936).&nbsp; 
Premchand believed that social realism was the way for Hindi literature,
 as opposed to the "feminine quality", tenderness and emotion of the 
contemporary Bengali literature. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

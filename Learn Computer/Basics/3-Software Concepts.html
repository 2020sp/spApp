<h2>Software Concepts</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>As you know, the hardware devices need user instructions to function. A set of instructions that achieve a single outcome are called program or procedure. Many programs functioning together to do a task make a&nbsp;<strong>software</strong>.</p> <p>For example, a word-processing software enables the user to create, edit and save documents. A web browser enables the user to view and share web pages and multimedia files. There are two categories of software &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>System Software</li> <li>Application Software</li> <li>Utility Software</li> </ul> <p>Let us discuss them in detail.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/system_software.jpg" alt="System Software" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h2>System Software</h2> <p>Software required to run the hardware parts of the computer and other application software are called&nbsp;<strong>system software</strong>. System software acts as&nbsp;<strong>interface</strong>&nbsp;between hardware and user applications. An interface is needed because hardware devices or machines and humans speak in different languages.</p> <p>Machines understand only binary language i.e. 0 (absence of electric signal) and 1 (presence of electric signal) while humans speak in English, French, German, Tamil, Hindi and many other languages. English is the pre-dominant language of interacting with computers. Software is required to convert all human instructions into machine understandable instructions. And this is exactly what system software does.</p> <p>Based on its function, system software is of four types &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Operating System</li> <li>Language Processor</li> <li>Device Drivers</li> </ul> <h3>Operating System</h3> <p>System software that is responsible for functioning of all hardware parts and their interoperability to carry out tasks successfully is called&nbsp;<strong>operating system (OS)</strong>. OS is the first software to be loaded into computer memory when the computer is switched on and this is called&nbsp;<strong>booting</strong>. OS manages a computer&rsquo;s basic functions like storing data in memory, retrieving files from storage devices, scheduling tasks based on priority, etc.</p> <h3>Language Processor</h3> <p>As discussed earlier, an important function of system software is to convert all user instructions into machine understandable language. When we talk of human machine interactions, languages are of three types &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p><strong>Machine-level language</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This language is nothing but a string of 0s and 1s that the machines can understand. It is completely machine dependent.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assembly-level language</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This language introduces a layer of abstraction by defining&nbsp;<strong>mnemonics</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Mnemonics</strong>&nbsp;are English like words or symbols used to denote a long string of 0s and 1s. For example, the word &ldquo;READ&rdquo; can be defined to mean that computer has to retrieve data from the memory. The complete&nbsp;<strong>instruction</strong>&nbsp;will also tell the memory address. Assembly level language is&nbsp;<strong>machine dependent</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>High level language</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This language uses English like statements and is completely independent of machines. Programs written using high level languages are easy to create, read and understand.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Program written in high level programming languages like Java, C++, etc. is called&nbsp;<strong>source code</strong>. Set of instructions in machine readable form is called&nbsp;<strong>object code</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>machine code</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>System software</strong>&nbsp;that converts source code to object code is called&nbsp;<strong>language processor</strong>. There are three types of language interpreters&minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p><strong>Assembler</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Converts assembly level program into machine level program.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Interpreter</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Converts high level programs into machine level program line by line.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Compiler</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Converts high level programs into machine level programs at one go rather than line by line.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Device Drivers</h3> <p>System software that controls and monitors functioning of a specific device on computer is called&nbsp;<strong>device driver</strong>. Each device like printer, scanner, microphone, speaker, etc. that needs to be attached externally to the system has a specific driver associated with it. When you attach a new device, you need to install its driver so that the OS knows how it needs to be managed.</p> <h2>Application Software</h2> <p>A software that performs a single task and nothing else is called&nbsp;<strong>application software</strong>. Application software are very specialized in their function and approach to solving a problem. So a spreadsheet software can only do operations with numbers and nothing else. A hospital management software will manage hospital activities and nothing else. Here are some commonly used application software &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Word processing</li> <li>Spreadsheet</li> <li>Presentation</li> <li>Database management</li> <li>Multimedia tools</li> </ul> <h2>Utility Software</h2> <p>Application software that assist system software in doing their work is called&nbsp;<strong>utility software</strong>. Thus utility software is actually a cross between system software and application software. Examples of utility software include &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Antivirus software</li> <li>Disk management tools</li> <li>File management tools</li> <li>Compression tools</li> <li>Backup tools</li> </ul> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

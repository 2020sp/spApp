<h2>Input & Output Ports</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>A connection point that acts as interface between the computer and external devices like mouse, printer, modem, etc. is called&nbsp;<strong>port</strong>. Ports are of two types &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p><strong>Internal port</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It connects the motherboard to internal devices like hard disk drive, CD drive, internal modem, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>External port</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It connects the motherboard to external devices like modem, mouse, printer, flash drives, etc.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/input_output_ports.jpg" alt="Input Output Ports" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <p>Let us look at some of the most commonly used ports.</p> <h2>Serial Port</h2> <p>Serial ports transmit data sequentially one bit at a time. So they need only one wire to transmit 8 bits. However it also makes them slower. Serial ports are usually 9-pin or 25-pin male connectors. They are also known as COM (communication) ports or RS323C ports.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/serial_ports.jpg" alt="Serial Ports" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h2>Parallel Port</h2> <p>Parallel ports can send or receive 8 bits or 1 byte at a time. Parallel ports come in form of 25-pin female pins and are used to connect printer, scanner, external hard disk drive, etc.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/parallel_ports.jpg" alt="Parallel Ports" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h2>USB Port</h2> <p>USB stands for Universal Serial Bus. It is the industry standard for short distance digital data connection. USB port is a standardized port to connect a variety of devices like printer, camera, keyboard, speaker, etc.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/images/usb_ports.jpg" alt="USB Port" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h2>PS-2 Port</h2> <p>PS/2 stands for&nbsp;<strong>Personal System/2</strong>. It is a female 6-pin port standard that connects to the male mini-DIN cable. PS/2 was introduced by IBM to connect mouse and keyboard to personal computers. This port is now mostly obsolete, though some systems compatible with IBM may have this port.</p> <h2>Infrared Port</h2> <p><strong>Infrared port</strong>&nbsp;is a port that enables wireless exchange of data within a radius of 10m. Two devices that have infrared ports are placed facing each other so that beams of infrared lights can be used to share data.</p> <h2>Bluetooth Port</h2> <p><strong>Bluetooth</strong>&nbsp;is a telecommunication specification that facilitates wireless connection between phones, computers and other digital devices over short range wireless connection. Bluetooth port enables synchronization between Bluetooth-enabled devices. There are two types of Bluetooth ports &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p><strong>Incoming</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is used to receive connection from Bluetooth devices.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Outgoing</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is used to request connection to other Bluetooth devices.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>FireWire Port</h2> <p>FireWire is Apple Computer&rsquo;s interface standard for enabling high speed communication using serial bus. It is also called IEEE 1394 and used mostly for audio and video devices like digital camcorders.</p> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

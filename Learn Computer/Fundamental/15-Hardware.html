<h2>Computer - Hardware</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Hardware represents the physical and tangible components of a computer, i.e. the components that can be seen and touched.</p> <p>Examples of Hardware are the following &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p><strong>Input devices</strong>&nbsp;&minus; keyboard, mouse, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Output devices</strong>&nbsp;&minus; printer, monitor, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Secondary storage devices</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Hard disk, CD, DVD, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Internal components</strong>&nbsp;&minus; CPU, motherboard, RAM, etc.</p> </li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Relationship between Hardware and Software</h2> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>Hardware and software are mutually dependent on each other. Both of them must work together to make a computer produce a useful output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Software cannot be utilized without supporting hardware.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hardware without a set of programs to operate upon cannot be utilized and is useless.</p> </li> <li> <p>To get a particular job done on the computer, relevant software should be loaded into the hardware.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hardware is a one-time expense.</p> </li> <li> <p>Software development is very expensive and is a continuing expense.</p> </li> <li> <p>Different software applications can be loaded on a hardware to run different jobs.</p> </li> <li> <p>A software acts as an interface between the user and the hardware.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the hardware is the 'heart' of a computer system, then the software is its 'soul'. Both are complementary to each other.</p> </li> </ul> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

<h2>Computer - Operating System</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>The Operating System is a program with the following features &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>An operating system is a program that acts as an interface between the software and the computer hardware.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is an integrated set of specialized programs used to manage overall resources and operations of the computer.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is a specialized software that controls and monitors the execution of all other programs that reside in the computer, including application programs and other system software.</p> </li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Objectives of Operating System</h2> <p>The objectives of the operating system are &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>To make the computer system convenient to use in an efficient manner.</p> </li> <li> <p>To hide the details of the hardware resources from the users.</p> </li> <li> <p>To provide users a convenient interface to use the computer system.</p> </li> <li> <p>To act as an intermediary between the hardware and its users, making it easier for the users to access and use other resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>To manage the resources of a computer system.</p> </li> <li> <p>To keep track of who is using which resource, granting resource requests, and mediating conflicting requests from different programs and users.</p> </li> <li> <p>To provide efficient and fair sharing of resources among users and programs.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Characteristics of Operating System</h2> <p>Here is a list of some of the most prominent characteristic features of Operating Systems &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p><strong>Memory Management</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Keeps track of the primary memory, i.e. what part of it is in use by whom, what part is not in use, etc. and allocates the memory when a process or program requests it.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Processor Management</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Allocates the processor (CPU) to a process and deallocates the processor when it is no longer required.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Device Management</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Keeps track of all the devices. This is also called I/O controller that decides which process gets the device, when, and for how much time.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>File Management</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Allocates and de-allocates the resources and decides who gets the resources.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Security</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Prevents unauthorized access to programs and data by means of passwords and other similar techniques.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Job Accounting</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Keeps track of time and resources used by various jobs and/or users.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Control Over System Performance</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Records delays between the request for a service and from the system.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Interaction with the Operators</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Interaction may take place via the console of the computer in the form of instructions. The Operating System acknowledges the same, does the corresponding action, and informs the operation by a display screen.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Error-detecting Aids</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Production of dumps, traces, error messages, and other debugging and error-detecting methods.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Coordination Between Other Software and Users</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Coordination and assignment of compilers, interpreters, assemblers, and other software to the various users of the computer systems.</p> </li> </ul> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

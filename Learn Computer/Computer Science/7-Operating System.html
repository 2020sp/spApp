<h2>Operating System</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>An operating system is the fundamental basis of all other application programs. Operating system is an intermediary between the users and the hardware.</p> <p>Operating system controls and coordinates the use of hardware among application programs. The major services of an operating system are &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Memory management</li> <li>Disk access</li> <li>Creating user interface</li> <li>Managing the different programs operating parallel</li> <li>Likewise, it controls and manage the hardware&rsquo;s working</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/operating_system.jpg" alt="Operating System" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h2>Applications of Operating System</h2> <p>Following are the major&nbsp;<em>applications</em>&nbsp;of an operating system &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>An operating system is accountable for the formation and deletion of files and directories.</p> </li> <li> <p>An operating system manages the process of deletion, suspension, resumption, and synchronization.</p> </li> <li> <p>An operating system manages memory space by allocation and de-allocation.</p> </li> <li> <p>An operating system stores, organizes, and names and protects the existing files.</p> </li> <li> <p>Further, an operating system manages all the components and devices of the computers system including modems, printers, plotters, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>In case, if any device fails, the operating system detects and notify.</p> </li> <li> <p>An operating system protects from destruction as well as from unauthorized use.</p> </li> <li> <p>An operating system facilitates the interface to user and hardware.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Types of Operating System</h2> <p>Following are the major types of operating system &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Disk Operating System (DOS)</li> <li>Windows Operating System</li> <li>Unix Operating System</li> </ul> <p>Let us now discuss each operating system in detail.</p> <h2>Disk Operating System</h2> <p>MS-DOS is one of the oldest and widely used operating system. DOS is a set of computer programs, the major functions of which are file management, allocation of system resources, providing essential features to control hardware devices.</p> <p>DOS commands can be typed in either upper case or lower case.</p> <h3>Features of DOS</h3> <p>Following are the significant features of DOS &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>It is a single user system.</li> <li>It controls program.</li> <li>It is machine independence.</li> <li>It manages (computer) files.</li> <li>It manages input and output system.</li> <li>It manages (computer) memory.</li> <li>It provides command processing facilities.</li> <li>It operates with Assembler.</li> </ul> <h3>Types of DOS Commands</h3> <p>Following are the major types of DOS Command &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p><strong>Internal Commands</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Commands such as DEL, COPY, TYPE, etc. are the internal commands that remain stored in computer memory.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>External Commands</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Commands like FORMAT, DISKCOPY, etc. are the external commands and remain stored on the disk.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Windows Operating System</h2> <p>The operating system window is the extension of the disk operating system.</p> <p>It is the most popular and simplest operating system; it can be used by any person who can read and understand basic English, as it does not require any special training.</p> <p>However, the Windows Operating System requires DOS to run the various application programs initially. Because of this reason, DOS should be installed into the memory and then window can be executed.</p> <h3>Elements of Windows OS</h3> <p>Following are the significant element of&nbsp;<strong>W</strong>indows&nbsp;<strong>O</strong>perating&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>ystem (WOS) &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Graphical User Interface</li> <li>Icons (pictures, documents, application, program icons, etc.)</li> <li>Taskbar</li> <li>Start button</li> <li>Windows explorer</li> <li>Mouse button</li> <li>Hardware compatibility</li> <li>Software compatibility</li> <li>Help, etc.</li> </ul> <h3>Versions of Windows Operating System</h3> <p>Following are the different versions of Windows Operating System &minus;</p> <table class="table table-bordered"> <tbody> <tr> <th>Version</th> <th>Year</th> <th>Version</th> <th>Year</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Window 1.01</td> <td>1985</td> <td>Windows XP Professional x64</td> <td>2005</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Windows NT 3.1</td> <td>1993</td> <td>Windows Vista</td> <td>2007</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Windows 95</td> <td>1995</td> <td>Windows 7</td> <td>2009</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Windows 98</td> <td>1998</td> <td>Windows 8</td> <td>2012</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Windows 2000</td> <td>2000</td> <td>Windows 10</td> <td>2015</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Windows ME</td> <td>2000</td> <td>Windows Server 2016</td> <td>2016</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Windows XP</td> <td>2001</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2>Unix Operating System</h2> <p>The Unix Operating System is the earliest operating system developed in 1970s. Let us consider the following points relating to the Unix Operating System &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>It is an operating system that has multitasking features.</p> </li> <li> <p>It has multiuser computer operating systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>It runs practically on every sort of hardware and provides stimulus to the open source movement.</p> </li> <li> <p>It has comparative complex functionality and hence an untrained user cannot use it; only the one who has taken training can use this system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Another drawback of this system is, it does not give notice or warn about the consequences of a user&rsquo;s action (whether user&rsquo;s action is right or wrong).</p> </li> </ul> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

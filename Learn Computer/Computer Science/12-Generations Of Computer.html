<h2>Generations of Computer</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>The development of computer systems is normally discussed as the development over different generations.</p> <p>With the succession of different generations, came the advancement in computer technology.</p> <h2>Computer Generations</h2> <p>Let us now discuss the development in Computer Technology over the different generations.</p> <h3>First Generation</h3> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>The period 1940 to 1956, roughly considered as the First Generation of Computer.</p> </li> <li> <p>The first generation computers were developed by using vacuum tube or thermionic valve machine.</p> </li> <li> <p>The input of this system was based on punched cards and paper tape; however, the output was displayed on printouts.</p> </li> <li> <p>The first generation computers worked on binary-coded concept (i.e., language of 0-1).&nbsp;<strong>Examples:</strong>&nbsp;ENIAC, EDVAC, etc.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/binarycoded_concept.jpg" alt="Binary-coded Concept" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h3>Second Generation</h3> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>The period 1956 to 1963 is roughly considered as the period of Second Generation of Computers.</p> </li> <li> <p>The second generation computers were developed by using transistor technology.</p> </li> <li> <p>In comparison to the first generation, the size of second generation was smaller.</p> </li> <li> <p>In comparison to computers of the first generation, the computing time taken by the computers of the second generation was lesser.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/second_generation_computers.jpg" alt="Second Generation Computers" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h3>Third Generation</h3> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>The period 1963 to 1971 is roughly considered as the period of Third Generation of computers.</p> </li> <li> <p>The third generation computers were developed by using the Integrated Circuit (IC) technology.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/third_generation_computers.jpg" alt="Third Generation Computers" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>In comparison to the computers of the second generation, the size of the computers of the third generation was smaller.</p> </li> <li> <p>In comparison to the computers of the second generation, the computing time taken by the computers of the third generation was lesser.</p> </li> <li> <p>The third generation computer consumed less power and also generated less heat.</p> </li> <li> <p>The maintenance cost of the computers in the third generation was also low.</p> </li> <li> <p>The computer system of the computers of the third generation was easier for commercial use.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Fourth Generation</h3> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>The period 1972 to 2010 is roughly considered as the fourth generation of computers.</p> </li> <li> <p>The fourth generation computers were developed by using microprocessor technology.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/fourth_generation_computers.jpg" alt="Fourth Generation Computers" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>By coming to fourth generation, computer became very small in size, it became portable.</p> </li> <li> <p>The machine of fourth generation started generating very low amount of heat.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is much faster and accuracy became more reliable.</p> </li> <li> <p>The production cost reduced to very low in comparison to the previous generation.</p> </li> <li> <p>It became available for the common people as well.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Fifth Generation</h3> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>The period 2010 to till date and beyond, roughly considered as the period of fifth generation of computers.</p> </li> <li> <p>By the time, the computer generation was being categorized on the basis of hardware only, but the fifth generation technology also included software.</p> </li> <li> <p>The computers of the fifth generation had high capability and large memory capacity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Working with computers of this generation was fast and multiple tasks could be performed simultaneously.</p> </li> <li> <p>Some of the popular advanced technologies of the fifth generation include Artificial intelligence, Quantum computation, Nanotechnology, Parallel processing, etc.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/fifth_generation.jpg" alt="Fifth Generation" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

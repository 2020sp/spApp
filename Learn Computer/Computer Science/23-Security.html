It is required for the following major reasons &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>To prevent damage of the hardware.</p> </li> <li> <p>To prevent theft or damage of the installed software.</p> </li> <li> <p>To prevent theft or damage of stored data and information.</p> </li> <li> <p>To prevent the disruption of service.</p> </li> <li> <p>Likewise, security system keeps the computer system safe by protecting the installed software and the stored data (information).</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Protection of Data and Information</h2> <p>Following are the important steps to protect data &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Make backup of all your important files.</li> <li>Keep your system virus by using anti-virus software.</li> <li>Keep updating your computer system.</li> <li>Run disk defragmenter and disk cleanup on certain interval of time.</li> <li>Use a firewall.</li> <li>Use anti-spyware software.</li> </ul> <p>Further, if you use internet, then you need to take greater precaution.

All these stored files create problem along with eating space.</p> <p>So, disk cleanup process cleans all these files and releases the space occupied by these unwanted files.</p> <p>Following are the simple steps of disk cleanup &minus;</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/disk_cleanup.jpg" alt="Disk Cleanup" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

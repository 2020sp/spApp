<h2>System</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>A computer system is an integrated form of different components that work together to give a desirable result. It has different component and each works for a specific purpose; however, they generate a common result as required by the user.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/computer_system.jpg" alt="Computer System" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h2>Components of Computer System</h2> <p>Let us now understand the following basic components of a computer system.</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Hardware</li> <li>Software</li> <li>Humanware</li> <li>Firmware</li> <li>Bridgeware</li> </ul> <h3>Hardware</h3> <p>The physical components collectively form the hardware of a computer system. Hardware comprises of the equipment that helps in the working system of the computer.</p> <p>Following are the different types of hardware components (which have specific functions) &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p><strong>Monitor</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It displays (visual) the result.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>CPU</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is the Central Processing Unit that controls the computer&rsquo;s functions and transmits data.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Motherboard</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is mainly accountable to establish communication between components and transmission of information.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>RAM</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is the Random Access Memory and responsible for the storage of programs that are currently running and also stores data temporarily.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hard Disk Drive</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is a permanent memory storage device.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Floppy Disk Drive</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is hardly being used in recent times.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Optical disks</strong>&nbsp;&minus; It is a device that also store data. For example, CD, DVD, etc.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Input &amp; Output Device</h2> <p>The following table categorically lists down the input and output device &minus;</p> <table class="table table-bordered"> <tbody> <tr> <th>Input Device</th> <th>Output Device</th> <th>Input Device</th> <th>Output Device</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Mouse</td> <td>Monitor</td> <td>Microphone</td> <td>Speaker</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Keyboard</td> <td>Printer</td> <td>Camera</td> <td>Earphone</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Scanner</td> <td>Projector</td> <td>Trackball</td> <td>Monitor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Touchpad</td> <td>Plotter</td> <td>Joystick</td> <td>Monitor</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2>Software</h2> <p>The hardware components can only function when software components are added to the computer system. Software is a program that performs different commands given by a user.</p> <p>Software is an intangible part of hardware and controls the sequence of operations.</p> <h3>Types of Software</h3> <p>Depending on the basic features and functionality, software can be categorized as &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Operating Systems (OS)</li> <li>Application Software (AS)</li> <li>E-accessibility Software</li> </ul> <p>Let us now discuss the software components in brief.</p> <h3>Operating System</h3> <p>This software helps to load the basic program automatically as soon as the computer is started. Following are the major types of operating system &minus;</p> <table class="table table-bordered"> <tbody> <tr> <th>Operating Software</th> <th>Examples</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Microsoft Windows</td> <td>XP, Vista, etc.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mac OS X</td> <td>Panther, Cheetah, Snow leopard, etc.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Linux</td> <td>Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Knoppix, etc.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>Application Software</h3> <p>The software, which can be used on an installed operating system, is known as application software. Following are the significant examples of application software &minus;</p> <table class="table table-bordered"> <tbody> <tr> <th>Application Software</th> <th>Examples</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Office programs</td> <td>Microsoft Office, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, etc.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="ts">Web browser</td> <td>Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, etc.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Antivirus Program</td> <td>Norton, McAfee, Quick Heal, Avira, Kaspersky, etc.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>E-accessibility Software</h3> <p>The E-accessibility software components additional facilities to users such as &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Voice recognition software</li> <li>Screen reader</li> <li>Magnifying tool</li> <li>On-screen keyboard</li> <li>Video games</li> <li>Learning software, etc.</li> </ul> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

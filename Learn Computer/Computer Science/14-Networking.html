<h2>Networking</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>A computer networking is a process of connecting two more than two computers with the purpose to share data, provide technical support, and to communicate (especially for the business purpose.</p> <p>Internet is the technology that is used to connect different computer systems (located in different geographic location). Networking technology has revolutionized the world and created a new arena for the overall development of every nation.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/computer_networking.jpg" alt="Computer Networking" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h2>Advantages of Networking</h2> <p>Let us now discuss the advantages of networking. The advantages are described below &minus;</p> <h3>Facility of Technical Support</h3> <p>Because of having computer networking, a person sitting in the United States of America provides technical support to a person sitting in a remote part of India.</p> <h3>Easy Sharing of Data</h3> <p>With the help of networking, it is very simple to share all formats of digital data from one computer system to another (irrespective of their geographic location).</p> <h3>Easy Sharing of Hardware Resource</h3> <p>With the help of networking, it has now become very simple to share the expensive resources including storage space, processor, fax, etc.</p> <h3>Easy Sharing Software</h3> <p>Through the networking system, it is easy to share and install the software from one computer system to another computer system.</p> <h3>Easy to Decentralize Data Processing</h3> <p>Through the networking system, it is very simple to decentralize the data processing system. It ultimately helps to control, secure, and manage the important data.</p> <h3>Easy to Communicate</h3> <p>With the help of networking, the communication system has now become highly efficient, frugal, and fast. The different modes of communication are text chatting, video chatting, emails, etc.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/easy_to_communicate.jpg" alt="Easy to Communicate" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h2>Types of Network</h2> <p>In this section, we will discuss the different types of network. The types are described below &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Local Area Network (LAN)</li> <li>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</li> <li>Wide Area Network (WAN)</li> </ul> <h2>Local Area Network</h2> <p>Local Area Network or simply LAN is the technique of interconnecting a few computers located in a given premise. It is normally used for a single business office or a residential apartment.</p> <p>The major purpose of such interconnectivity is to establish a communication system in order to make the work easier.</p> <p>However, in such connectivity, some other devices can also be attached such as laser printers, fax machine, etc.</p> <h2>Metropolitan Area Network</h2> <p>Metropolitan Area Network or simply MAN is a system of network that normally covers a large metropolitan area (city part).</p> <p>It provides high speed Internet services throughout the area covered within the network.</p> <h2>Wide Area Network</h2> <p>Wide Area Network or simply WAN is a system of network that covers a large geographical area across the world.</p> <p>The services of WAN are provided by public (government) agencies as well as private agencies. The network also provides the facility to access databases located remotely.</p> <p>The WAN system is highly beneficial for MNCs and other big corporate companies (offering online services).</p> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

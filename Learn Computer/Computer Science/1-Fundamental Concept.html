<h2>Fundamental Concept</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>A computer is basically a programmable machine capable to perform arithmetic and logical operations automatically and sequentially. It is also known as a data processor, as it can store, process, and retrieve data as per the wish of the user.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computer_science/images/computer.jpg" alt="Computer" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <p>Data processing involves the following three activities &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Input of data</li> <li>Manipulation/processing of data</li> <li>Giving output (i.e. management of output result)</li> <li>In computer system, data is arranged orderly and systematically.</li> </ul> <p>The term &ldquo;computer&rdquo; is derived from a Latin term &ldquo;compute,&rdquo; which means &lsquo;to calculate.&rsquo; Initially, the computer system had been designed to calculate; it was intended to be a computing device. However, over a period of time, this device technically advanced; at present, it can perform a wide range of desirable works apart from data processing.</p> <h2>Major Functions of Computer System</h2> <p>Following are the core functions of a computer system &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>A computer accepts the command and/or data as input given by the user.</p> </li> <li> <p>A computer follows the instructions and stores the data given by the user.</p> </li> <li> <p>A computer processes the data as per the instructions given by the user.</p> </li> <li> <p>A computer gives the desirable results in the form of output.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Salient Features of Computer System</h2> <p>Following are the salient features of a Computer System &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p><strong>Automation</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The operating system of a computer system is automatic, as no human intervention is required; simply you need to give the command and then it will do the work automatically.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Speed</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Depending upon the power of the computer, it can perform, it can take Millions of instructions per second.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Storage</strong>&nbsp;&minus; A computer system can store enormous quantity of data in different format. The storage capacity of a computer system is normally expressed in terms of Kilobytes (KB), Megabytes (MB), Gigabytes (GB), or Terabytes (TB).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Accuracy</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The accuracy of a computer system is very high.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Versatility</strong>&nbsp;&minus; A computer system is capable of performing a wide range of tasks.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Diligence</strong>&nbsp;&minus; A computer neither get tired nor lose concentration.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Reliability</strong>&nbsp;&minus; As a computer system always gives accurate result; therefore, its reliability is very high.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Vast memory</strong>&nbsp;&minus; A computer system can have a wide range of memory which can recall the desired data at any point of time.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Evolution of Computer System</h2> <p>The present Computer System has evolved after centuries of efforts from different intellectuals who contributed their works during different periods of time.</p> <p><strong>Abacus</strong>&nbsp;is (most likely) considered as the earlier counting device.</p> <p>Let us now read about the innovators who contributed immensely in the development of a computer system.</p> <h3>John Napier</h3> <p>Napier was a Scottish mathematician who invented logarithms.</p> <p>Further, Napier also invented a computing device, which consisted of sticks with numbers imprinted on them. Napier named sticks &lsquo;bones,&rsquo; as they were made up of bones.</p> <h3>Blaise Pascal</h3> <p>Pascal was a French mathematician who invented a machine based on gear wheels, which helped greatly in calculation.</p> <h3>Charles Babbage</h3> <p>Babbage was an English Polymath, Mathematician, Mechanical Engineer, Philosopher, and Inventor. In 1822, he developed a machine capable to calculate the successive difference of expression and prepared a table which helped him in his calculations.</p> <h3>Lady Ada Lovelace</h3> <p>Lovelace was an English mathematician, who researched on Babbage&rsquo;s work. She has given the concept that &lsquo;computers can be programmed&rsquo;. Her work helped a great deal in the advancement of computer system.</p> <h3>John Atanstoff</h3> <p>With the assistance of Berry, John Atanstoff developed the Atanstoff Berry Computer (more popular as ABC) in 1937. It marked the beginning of the development of electronic digital computer.</p> <h3>John Mauchly and Eckart</h3> <p>In 1947, John Mauchly and Eckart developed the first large scale Electronic Digital Computer. It was called the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC).</p> <h3>Maurice V. Wilkes</h3> <p>In 1949, Wilkes (at Cambridge University) designed Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC). It was the first computer that started its operating system on the stored program concept.</p> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

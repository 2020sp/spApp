A computer system can be protected from virus through the following &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Installation of an effective antivirus software.</li> <li>Patching up the operating system.</li> <li>Patching up the client software.</li> <li>Putting highly secured Passwords.</li> <li>Use of Firewalls.</li> </ul> <h2>Most Effective Antivirus</h2> <p>Following are the most popular and effective antivirus from which you can choose one for your personal computer &minus;</p> <ul class="list"> <li>McAfee Antivirus Plus</li> <li>Symantec Norton Antivirus</li> <li>Avast Pro Antivirus</li> <li>Bitdefender Antivirus Plus</li> <li>Kaspersky Anti-Virus</li> <li>Avira Antivirus</li> <li>Webroot Secure Anywhere Antivirus</li> <li>Emsisoft Anti-Malware</li> <li>Quick Heal Antivirus</li> <li>ESET NOD32 Antivirus</li> </ul> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

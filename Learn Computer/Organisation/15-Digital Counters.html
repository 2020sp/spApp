<h2>Digital Counters</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Counter is a sequential circuit. A digital circuit which is used for a counting pulses is known counter. Counter is the widest application of flip-flops. It is a group of flip-flops with a clock signal applied. Counters are of two types.</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Asynchronous or ripple counters.</li> <li>Synchronous counters.</li> </ul> <h2>Asynchronous or ripple counters</h2> <p>The logic diagram of a 2-bit ripple up counter is shown in figure. The toggle (T) flip-flop are being used. But we can use the JK flip-flop also with J and K connected permanently to logic 1. External clock is applied to the clock input of flip-flop A and Q<sub>A</sub>&nbsp;output is applied to the clock input of the next flip-flop i.e. FF-B.</p> <h3>Logical Diagram</h3> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/ripple_counter_diagram.jpg" alt="Logic Diagram of Asynchronous or ripple counters" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h3>Operation</h3> <table class="table table-bordered"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.N.</th> <th>Condition</th> <th>Operation</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td><strong>Initially let both the FFs be in the reset state</strong></td> <td>Q<sub>B</sub>Q<sub>A</sub>&nbsp;= 00 initially</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td><strong>After 1st negative clock edge</strong></td> <td> <p>As soon as the first negative clock edge is applied, FF-A will toggle and Q<sub>A</sub>&nbsp;will be equal to 1.</p> <p>Q<sub>A</sub>&nbsp;is connected to clock input of FF-B.

A mode control (M) input is also provided to select either up or down mode. A combinational circuit is required to be designed and used between each pair of flip-flop in order to achieve the up/down operation.</p> <ul class="list"> <li>Type of up/down counters</li> <li>UP/DOWN ripple counters</li> <li>UP/DOWN synchronous counter</li> </ul> <h2>UP/DOWN Ripple Counters</h2> <p>In the UP/DOWN ripple counter all the FFs operate in the toggle mode. So either T flip-flops or JK flip-flops are to be used. The LSB flip-flop receives clock directly. But the clock to every other FF is obtained from (Q = Q bar) output of the previous FF.</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p><strong>UP counting mode (M=0)</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The Q output of the preceding FF is connected to the clock of the next stage if up counting is to be achieved. For this mode, the mode select input M is at logic 0 (M=0).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>DOWN counting mode (M=1)</strong>&nbsp;&minus; If M = 1, then the Q bar output of the preceding FF is connected to the next FF. This will operate the counter in the counting mode.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Example</h3> <p>3-bit binary up/down ripple counter.</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>3-bit &minus; hence three FFs are required.</p> </li> <li> <p>UP/DOWN &minus; So a mode control input is essential.</p> </li> <li> <p>For a ripple up counter, the Q output of preceding FF is connected to the clock input of the next one.</p> </li> <li> <p>For a ripple up counter, the Q output of preceding FF is connected to the clock input of the next one.</p> </li> <li> <p>For a ripple down counter, the Q bar output of preceding FF is connected to the clock input of the next one.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let the selection of Q and Q bar output of the preceding FF be controlled by the mode control input M such that, If M = 0, UP counting. So connect Q to CLK. If M = 1, DOWN counting. So connect Q bar to CLK.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Block Diagram</h3> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/updown_counter_diagram.jpg" alt="Block Diagram of Up/Down counters" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h3>Truth Table</h3> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/updown_counter_truthtable.jpg" alt="Truth Table of Up/Down counters" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h3>Operation</h3> <table class="table table-bordered"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.N.</th> <th>Condition</th> <th>Operation</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td><strong>Case 1 &minus; With M = 0 (Up counting mode)</strong></td> <td> <p>If M = 0 and M bar = 1, then the AND gates 1 and 3 in fig. will be enabled whereas the AND gates 2 and 4 will be disabled.</p> <p>Hence Q<sub>A</sub>&nbsp;gets connected to the clock input of FF-B and Q<sub>B</sub>gets connected to the clock input of FF-C.</p> <p>These connections are same as those for the normal up counter. Thus with M = 0 the circuit work as an up counter.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td><strong>Case 2: With M = 1 (Down counting mode)</strong></td> <td> <p>If M = 1, then AND gates 2 and 4 in fig. are enabled whereas the AND gates 1 and 3 are disabled.</p> <p>Hence Q<sub>A</sub>&nbsp;bar gets connected to the clock input of FF-B and Q<sub>B</sub>&nbsp;bar gets connected to the clock input of FF-C.</p> <p>These connections will produce a down counter. Thus with M = 1 the circuit works as a down counter.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2>Modulus Counter (MOD-N Counter)</h2> <p>The 2-bit ripple counter is called as MOD-4 counter and 3-bit ripple counter is called as MOD-8 counter.

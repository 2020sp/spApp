<h2>Boolean Algebra</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Boolean Algebra is used to analyze and simplify the digital (logic) circuits. It uses only the binary numbers i.e. 0 and 1. It is also called as&nbsp;<strong>Binary Algebra</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>logical Algebra</strong>. Boolean algebra was invented by&nbsp;<strong>George Boole</strong>&nbsp;in 1854.</p> <h2>Rule in Boolean Algebra</h2> <p>Following are the important rules used in Boolean algebra.</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p>Variable used can have only two values. Binary 1 for HIGH and Binary 0 for LOW.</p> </li> <li> <p>Complement of a variable is represented by an overbar (-). Thus, complement of variable B is represented as&nbsp;<img class="inline" src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/b_bar.jpg" alt="B Bar" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" />. Thus if B = 0 then&nbsp;<img class="inline" src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/b_bar.jpg" alt="B Bar" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" />= 1 and B = 1 then&nbsp;<img class="inline" src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/b_bar.jpg" alt="B Bar" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" />&nbsp;= 0.</p> </li> <li> <p>ORing of the variables is represented by a plus (+) sign between them. For example ORing of A, B, C is represented as A + B + C.</p> </li> <li> <p>Logical ANDing of the two or more variable is represented by writing a dot between them such as A.B.C. Sometime the dot may be omitted like ABC.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Boolean Laws</h2> <p>There are six types of Boolean Laws.</p> <h3>Commutative law</h3> <p>Any binary operation which satisfies the following expression is referred to as commutative operation.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/commutative.jpg" alt="Commutative Law" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <p>Commutative law states that changing the sequence of the variables does not have any effect on the output of a logic circuit.</p> <h3>Associative law</h3> <p>This law states that the order in which the logic operations are performed is irrelevant as their effect is the same.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/associative.jpg" alt="Associative Law" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h3>Distributive law</h3> <p>Distributive law states the following condition.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/distributive.jpg" alt="Distributive Law" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h3>AND law</h3> <p>These laws use the AND operation. Therefore they are called as&nbsp;<strong>AND</strong>&nbsp;laws.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/and.jpg" alt="AND Law" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h3>OR law</h3> <p>These laws use the OR operation. Therefore they are called as&nbsp;<strong>OR</strong>&nbsp;laws.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/or.jpg" alt="OR Law" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h3>INVERSION law</h3> <p>This law uses the NOT operation. The inversion law states that double inversion of a variable results in the original variable itself.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/not.jpg" alt="NOT Law" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h2>Important Boolean Theorems</h2> <p>Following are few important boolean Theorems.</p> <table class="table table-bordered"> <tbody> <tr> <th width="35%">Boolean function/theorems</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Boolean Functions</p> </td> <td>Boolean Functions and Expressions, K-Map and NAND Gates realization</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>De Morgan's Theorems</p> </td> <td>De Morgan's Theorem 1 and Theorem 2</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

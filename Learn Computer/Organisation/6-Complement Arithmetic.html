<h2>Complement Arithmetic</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Complements are used in the digital computers in order to simplify the subtraction operation and for the logical manipulations. For each radix-r system (radix r represents base of number system) there are two types of complements.</p> <table class="table table-bordered"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.N.</th> <th>Complement</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Radix Complement</td> <td>The radix complement is referred to as the r's complement</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Diminished Radix Complement</td> <td>The diminished radix complement is referred to as the (r-1)'s complement</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2>Binary system complements</h2> <p>As the binary system has base r = 2. So the two types of complements for the binary system are 2's complement and 1's complement.</p> <h3>1's complement</h3> <p>The 1's complement of a number is found by changing all 1's to 0's and all 0's to 1's. This is called as taking complement or 1's complement. Example of 1's Complement is as follows.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/1s_complement.jpg" alt="1's complement" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h3>2's complement</h3> <p>The 2's complement of binary number is obtained by adding 1 to the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of 1's complement of the number.</p> <p>2's complement = 1's complement + 1</p> <p>Example of 2's Complement is as follows.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/2s_complement.jpg" alt="2's complement" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

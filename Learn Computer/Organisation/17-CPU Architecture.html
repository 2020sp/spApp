<h2>CPU Architecture</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>Microprocessing unit is synonymous to central processing unit, CPU used in traditional computer. Microprocessor (MPU) acts as a device or a group of devices which do the following tasks.</p> <ul class="list"> <li>communicate with peripherals devices</li> <li>provide timing signal</li> <li>direct data flow</li> <li>perform computer tasks as specified by the instructions in memory</li> </ul> <h2>8085 Microprocessor</h2> <p>The 8085 microprocessor is an 8-bit general purpose microprocessor which is capable to address 64k of memory. This processor has forty pins, requires +5 V single power supply and a 3-MHz single-phase clock.</p> <h3>Block Diagram</h3> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/microprocessor_blockdiagram.jpg" alt="8080 Mircroprocessor block diagram" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h2>ALU</h2> <p>The ALU perform the computing function of microprocessor. It includes the accumulator, temporary register, arithmetic &amp; logic circuit &amp; and five flags. Result is stored in accumulator &amp; flags.</p> <h3>Block Diagram</h3> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/alu.jpg" alt="ALU" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h2>Accumulator</h2> <p>It is an 8-bit register that is part of ALU. This register is used to store 8-bit data &amp; in performing arithmetic &amp; logic operation. The result of operation is stored in accumulator.</p> <h3>Diagram</h3> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/accumulator.jpg" alt="Accumulator" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h2>Flags</h2> <p>Flags are programmable. They can be used to store and transfer the data from the registers by using instruction. The ALU includes five flip-flops that are set and reset according to data condition in accumulator and other registers.</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p><strong>S (Sign) flag</strong>&nbsp;&minus; After the execution of an arithmetic operation, if bit D<sub>7</sub>&nbsp;of the result is 1, the sign flag is set. It is used to signed number. In a given byte, if D<sub>7</sub>&nbsp;is 1 means negative number. If it is zero means it is a positive number.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Z (Zero) flag</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The zero flag is set if ALU operation result is 0.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>AC (Auxiliary Carry) flag</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In arithmetic operation, when carry is generated by digit D3 and passed on to digit D<sub>4</sub>, the AC flag is set. This flag is used only internally BCD operation.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>P (Parity) flag</strong>&nbsp;&minus; After arithmetic or logic operation, if result has even number of 1s, the flag is set. If it has odd number of 1s, flag is reset.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>C (Carry) flag</strong>&nbsp;&minus; If arithmetic operation result is in a carry, the carry flag is set, otherwise it is reset.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Register section</h2> <p>It is basically a storage device and transfers data from registers by using instructions.</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p><strong>Stack Pointer (SP)</strong>&nbsp;&minus; The stack pointer is also a 16-bit register which is used as a memory pointer. It points to a memory location in Read/Write memory known as stack. In between execution of program, sometime data to be stored in stack. The beginning of the stack is defined by loading a 16-bit address in the stack pointer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Program Counter (PC)</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This 16-bit register deals with fourth operation to sequence the execution of instruction. This register is also a memory pointer. Memory location have 16-bit address. It is used to store the execution address. The function of the program counter is to point to memory address from which next byte is to be fetched.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Storage registers</strong>&nbsp;&minus; These registers store 8-bit data during a program execution. These registers are identified as B, C, D, E, H, L. They can be combined as register pair BC, DE and HL to perform some 16 bit operations.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Time and Control Section</h2> <p>This unit is responsible to synchronize Microprocessor operation as per the clock pulse and to generate the control signals which are necessary for smooth communication between Microprocessor and peripherals devices. The RD bar and WR bar signals are synchronous pulses which indicates whether data is available on the data bus or not. The control unit is responsible to control the flow of data between microprocessor, memory and peripheral devices.</p> <h3>PIN diagram</h3> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/pin_diagram.jpg" alt="PIN diagram" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <p>All the signal can be classified into six groups</p> <table class="table table-bordered"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.N.</th> <th>Group</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td><strong>Address bus</strong></td> <td> <p>The 8085 microprocessor has 8 signal line, A<sub>15</sub>&nbsp;- A<sub>8</sub>&nbsp;which are uni directional and used as a high order address bus.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td><strong>Data bus</strong></td> <td> <p>The signal line AD7 - AD0 are bi-directional for dual purpose.

The instruction is divided into group of bits called field. The way instruction is expressed is known as instruction format. It is usually represented in the form of rectangular box. The instruction format may be of the following types.</p> <h2>Variable Instruction Formats</h2> <p>These are the instruction formats in which the instruction length varies on the basis of opcode &amp; address specifiers. For Example, VAX instruction vary between 1 and 53 bytes while X86 instruction vary between 1 and 17 bytes.</p> <h3>Format</h3> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/variable_instruction_format.jpg" alt="Variable Instruction Format" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h3>Advantage</h3> <p>These formats have good code density.</p> <h3>Drawback</h3> <p>These instruction formats are very difficult to decode and pipeline.</p> <h2>Fixed Instruction Formats</h2> <p>In this type of instruction format, all instructions are of same size. For Example, MIPS, Power PC, Alpha, ARM.</p> <h3>Format</h3> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/fixed_instruction_format.jpg" alt="Fixed Instruction Format" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h3>Advantage</h3> <p>They are easy to decode &amp; pipeline.</p> <h3>Drawback</h3> <p>They don't have good code density.</p> <h2>Hybrid Instruction Formats</h2> <p>In this type of instruction formats, we have multiple format length specified by opcode. For example, IBM 360/70, MIPS 16, Thumb.</p> <h3>Format</h3> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/images/hybrid_instruction_format.jpg" alt="Hybrid Instruction Format" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h3>Advantage</h3> <p>These compromise between code density &amp; instruction of these type are very easy to decode.</p> <h2>Addressing Modes</h2> <p>Addressing mode provides different ways for accessing an address to given data to a processor. Operated data is stored in the memory location, each instruction required certain data on which it has to operate. There are various techniques to specify address of data. These techniques are called Addressing Modes.</p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p><strong>Direct addressing mode</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In the direct addressing mode, address of the operand is given in the instruction and data is available in the memory location which is provided in instruction. We will move this data in desired location.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Indirect addressing mode</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In the indirect addressing mode, the instruction specifies a register which contain the address of the operand. Both internal RAM and external RAM can be accessed via indirect addressing mode.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Immediate addressing mode</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In the immediate addressing mode, direct data is given in the operand which move the data in accumulator. It is very fast.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Relative addressing mode</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In the relative address mode, the effective address is determined by the index mode by using the program counter in stead of general purpose processor register. This mode is called relative address mode.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Index addressing mode</strong>&nbsp;&minus; In the index address mode, the effective address of the operand is generated by adding a content value to the contents of the register. This mode is called index address mode.</p> </li> </ul> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

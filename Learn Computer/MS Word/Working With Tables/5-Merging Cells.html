<h2>Merging Cells</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to merge table cells in Word 2010. Microsoft Word allows the merging of two or more cells to create one large cell. You will frequently need to merge columns of the top row to create the title of the table. You can merge cells either row-wise or column-wise, rather you cannot merge cells diagonally. This chapter will teach you how to merge multiple rows or columns.</p> <h2>Merging Cells</h2> <p>The following steps will help you merge table cells in a Word document.</p> <p><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Bring your mouse pointer position inside the first cell that you want to merge. Now press the&nbsp;<strong>Shift</strong>&nbsp;key and click the cells around the cell which you want to merge into the first cell. This will highlight the cells which you click and they will be ready to be merged.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/selected_cells.jpg" alt="Selected Cells" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <p><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Now click the&nbsp;<strong>Layout tab</strong>&nbsp;and then click the&nbsp;<strong>Merge Cells</strong>&nbsp;button which will merge all the selected cells.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/merged_cells.jpg" alt="Merged Cells" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <p>After merging the cells, all the content of the cells will be scrambled which you can fix later as you like. For example, you can convert the merged cells text into title or some other description. For example, let us have center-aligned and bigger font text as follows on top of the table.</p> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

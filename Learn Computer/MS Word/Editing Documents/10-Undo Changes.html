<h2>Undo Changes</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to undo and redo changes in Word 2010. Microsoft word provides two important features called the&nbsp;<strong>Undo</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Redo</strong>. The Undo feature is used to undo the previous action and the&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Redo</strong>&nbsp;feature is used to repeat the previous action.</p> <p>For example, if you mistakenly delete text, you can use the&nbsp;<strong>Undo</strong>&nbsp;feature to recover it. In a similar way, if you delete a character and you want to delete more characters then you can use the&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;operation.</p> <h2>How to use Undo &amp; Repeat operations</h2> <p>You can access the Undo and Repeat buttons from the Quick Access toolbar. You should make a note that the&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;button is also called&nbsp;<strong>Redo</strong>&nbsp;button and both the operations have the same meaning.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/undo_button.jpg" alt="Undo and Repeat Buttons" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <p>Here is the simple procedure to apply&nbsp;<strong>undo</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>repeat</strong>&nbsp;(redo) operations &minus;</p> <p><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Let us type some text in a blank document. Now click the&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>(Redo) button and you will see that Word will repeat the same operation for you.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/repeat_operation.jpg" alt="Repeat Operation" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <p><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Now to examine the&nbsp;<strong>undo</strong>&nbsp;operation, let us delete the last word&nbsp;<strong>operation</strong>&nbsp;character by character so that you have the following text remaining in the line.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/undo_operation.jpg" alt="Undo Operation" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <p><strong>Step 3</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Let us try to click the&nbsp;<strong>Undo</strong>&nbsp;button one by one. You will see that Word will recover all the deleted characters one by one after performing a few undo operations.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/word/images/undo_operation2.jpg" alt="Undo Operation2" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h2>Shortcuts to use Undo &amp; Repeat operations</h2> <p>Though you can access the&nbsp;<strong>Undo</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Repeat</strong>&nbsp;commands from the Quick Access toolbar, but because these commands are the most frequently used commands, we recommend you memorize their keyboard shortcuts which are as follows &minus;</p> <table class="table table-bordered"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.No</th> <th>Shortcuts &amp; Operation</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td> <p><strong>Ctrl + Z</strong></p> <p>Undoes the previous action.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td> <p><strong>Ctrl + Y</strong></p> <p>Repeats the previous action.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Note that if the previous action was Undo,&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl+Y</strong>&nbsp;redoes the Undone action.</p> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }

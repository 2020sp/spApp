<h2>Delete Text</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>In this chapter, we will discuss how to delete text in Word 2010. It is very common to delete text and retype the content in your Word document. You might type something you did not want to type or there is something extra which is not required in the document. Regardless of the reason, Word offers you various ways of deleting the text in partial or complete content of the document.</p> <h2>Using Backspace &amp; Delete Keys</h2> <p>The most basic deletion technique is to delete characters one at a time by pressing either the backspace key or the delete key. Following table describes how you can delete single character or a whole word by using either of these two keys &minus;</p> <table class="table table-bordered"> <tbody> <tr> <th>S.No</th> <th>Keys &amp; Deletion Methods</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td> <p><strong>Backspace</strong></p> <p>Keep the insertion point just after the character you want to delete and press the&nbsp;<strong>Backspace</strong>&nbsp;key. Word deletes the character immediately to the left of the insertion point.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td> <p><strong>Ctrl + Backspace</strong></p> <p>Keep the insertion point just after the word you want to delete and press&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl + Backspace</strong>&nbsp;key.

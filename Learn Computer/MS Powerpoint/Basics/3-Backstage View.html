<h2>Backstage View</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>In Office 2010, Microsoft replaced the traditional file menu with the new&nbsp;<strong>Backstage</strong>&nbsp;view. This view not only offers all the menu items under the file menu, but additional details which makes management of your files a lot easier.</p> <h2>Accessing Backstage View</h2> <p>You can access the Backstage view simply by clicking on the File tab. You can exit this view by clicking on any tab (including the File tab again). You can also press the '<strong>Esc</strong>' button on the keyboard.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/backstage_view.jpg" alt="PowerPoint Backstage" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <h2>Organization of Backstage View</h2> <p>The backstage view has three sections or panes.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/backstage_view2.jpg" alt="PowerPoint Backstage" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <ul class="list"> <li> <p><strong>First Pane</strong>&nbsp;&minus; This is the commands pane which consists of all the commands you would typically find in the file menu of older versions.

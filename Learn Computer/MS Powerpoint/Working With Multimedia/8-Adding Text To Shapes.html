<h2>Adding Text to Shapes</h2> <hr> </hr> <h1></h1> <p>One of the great aspects of PowerPoint is that you can treat the shapes as text boxes too. This becomes useful when you want to type some text within a shape and ensure the text does not overflow the boundaries of the shape. By being able to enter text within the shape, PowerPoint will ensure the text stays contained and you do not have to worry about fixing it.</p> <p>The following steps will help you add text to the shapes in PowerPoint.</p> <p><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Right-click on the shape to which you want to add the text and select the&nbsp;<strong>Edit Text</strong>&nbsp;option.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/edit_text_menu_option.jpg" alt="Microsoft PowerPoint 2010" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <p><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;&minus; Start typing the text into the shape. Once you are done, click the cursor anywhere outside the shape.</p> <p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powerpoint/images/typed_text_within_shape.jpg" alt="Microsoft PowerPoint 2010" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" /></p> <p>An alternative way of adding text to shape is to select the shape and start typing directly. Once you have the text within the shape you can format the text using the font related features available in PowerPoint.</p> <style type="text/css"> h2 { color:#0000FF; }
